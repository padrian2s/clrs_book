94   Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer


        The recurrence (4.20) describes the running time of an algorithm that divides a
     problem of size n into a subproblems, each of size n=b, where a and b are positive
     constants. The a subproblems are solved recursively, each in time T .n=b/. The
     function f .n/ encompasses the cost of dividing the problem and combining the
     results of the subproblems. For example, the recurrence arising from Strassen’s
     algorithm has a D 7, b D 2, and f .n/ D ‚.n2 /.
        As a matter of technical correctness, the recurrence is not actually well deﬁned,
     because n=b might not be an integer. Replacing each of the a terms T .n=b/ with
     either T .bn=bc/ or T .dn=be/ will not affect the asymptotic behavior of the recur-
     rence, however. (We will prove this assertion in the next section.) We normally
     ﬁnd it convenient, therefore, to omit the ﬂoor and ceiling functions when writing
     divide-and-conquer recurrences of this form.

     The master theorem
     The master method depends on the following theorem.

     Theorem 4.1 (Master theorem)
     Let a  1 and b > 1 be constants, let f .n/ be a function, and let T .n/ be deﬁned
     on the nonnegative integers by the recurrence
     T .n/ D aT .n=b/ C f .n/ ;
     where we interpret n=b to mean either bn=bc or dn=be. Then T .n/ has the follow-
     ing asymptotic bounds:
     1. If f .n/ D O.nlogb a / for some constant  > 0, then T .n/ D ‚.nlogb a /.
     2. If f .n/ D ‚.nlogb a /, then T .n/ D ‚.nlogb a lg n/.
     3. If f .n/ D .nlogb aC / for some constant  > 0, and if af .n=b/  cf .n/ for
        some constant c < 1 and all sufﬁciently large n, then T .n/ D ‚.f .n//.


        Before applying the master theorem to some examples, let’s spend a moment
     trying to understand what it says. In each of the three cases, we compare the
     function f .n/ with the function nlogb a . Intuitively, the larger of the two functions
     determines the solution to the recurrence. If, as in case 1, the function nlogb a is the
     larger, then the solution is T .n/ D ‚.nlogb a /. If, as in case 3, the function f .n/
     is the larger, then the solution is T .n/ D ‚.f .n//. If, as in case 2, the two func-
     tions are the same size, we multiply by a logarithmic factor, and the solution is
     T .n/ D ‚.nlogb a lg n/ D ‚.f .n/ lg n/.
        Beyond this intuition, you need to be aware of some technicalities. In the ﬁrst
     case, not only must f .n/ be smaller than nlogb a , it must be polynomially smaller.
