Corollary 29.9
Let xN be a feasible solution to a primal linear program .A; b; c/, and let yN be a
feasible solution to the corresponding dual linear program. If
Xn           Xm
    cj xNj D     bi yNi ;
j D1               i D1

then xN and yN are optimal solutions to the primal and dual linear programs, respec-
tively.

Proof By Lemma 29.8, the objective value of a feasible solution to the primal
cannot exceed that of a feasible solution to the dual. The primal linear program is
a maximization problem and the dual is a minimization problem. Thus, if feasible
solutions xN and yN have the same objective value, neither can be improved.

    Before proving that there always is a dual solution whose value is equal to that
of an optimal primal solution, we describe how to ﬁnd such a solution. When
we ran the simplex algorithm on the linear program in (29.53)–(29.57), the ﬁnal
iteration yielded the slack form (29.72)–(29.75) with objective ´ D 28  x3 =6 
x5 =6 2x6 =3, B D f1; 2; 4g, and N D f3; 5; 6g. As we shall show below, the basic
solution associated with the ﬁnal slack form is indeed an optimal solution to the
linear program; an optimal solution to linear program (29.53)–(29.57) is therefore
.xN 1 ; xN 2 ; xN 3 / D .8; 4; 0/, with objective value .3  8/ C .1  4/ C .2  0/ D 28. As
we also show below, we can read off an optimal dual solution: the negatives of the
coefﬁcients of the primal objective function are the values of the dual variables.
More precisely, suppose that the last slack form of the primal is
