35.5 The subset-sum problem                                                     1131

Line 2 initializes the list L0 to be the list containing just the element 0. The for
loop in lines 3–6 computes Li as a sorted list containing a suitably trimmed ver-
sion of the set Pi , with all elements larger than t removed. Since we create Li
from Li 1 , we must ensure that the repeated trimming doesn’t introduce too much
compounded inaccuracy. In a moment, we shall see that A PPROX -S UBSET-S UM
returns a correct approximation if one exists.
   As an example, suppose we have the instance
S D h104; 102; 201; 101i
with t D 308 and  D 0:40. The trimming parameter ı is =8 D 0:05. A PPROX -
S UBSET-S UM computes the following values on the indicated lines:
