D-2 Permutations deﬁned by matrix-vector multiplication over GF.2/
One class of permutations of the integers in the set Sn D f0; 1; 2; : : : ; 2n  1g is


 
deﬁned by matrix multiplication over GF.2/. For each integer x in Sn , we view its
binary representation as an n-bit vector

     x0
     x1
     x2        ;
      ::
       :
     xn1
              Pn1
where x D i D0 xi 2i . If A is an n n matrix in which each entry is either 0
or 1, then we can deﬁne a permutation mapping each value x in Sn to the number
whose binary representation is the matrix-vector product Ax. Here, we perform
all arithmetic over GF.2/: all values are either 0 or 1, and with one exception the
usual rules of addition and multiplication apply. The exception is that 1 C 1 D 0.
You can think of arithmetic over GF.2/ as being just like regular integer arithmetic,
except that you use only the least signiﬁcant bit.
   As an example, for S2 D f0; 1; 2; 3g, the matrix

deﬁnes the following permutation A : A .0/ D 0, A .1/ D 3, A .2/ D 2,
A .3/ D 1. To see why A .3/ D 1, observe that, working in GF.2/,
