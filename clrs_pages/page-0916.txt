a. Verify that complementary slackness holds for the linear program in lines
   (29.53)–(29.57).

b. Prove that complementary slackness holds for any primal linear program and
   its corresponding dual.

c. Prove that a feasible solution xN to a primal linear program given in lines
   (29.16)–(29.18) is optimal if and only if there exist values yN D .yN1 ; yN2 ; : : : ; yNm /
   such that
   1. yN is a feasible solution to the dual linear program given in (29.83)–(29.85),

29-3 Integer linear programming
An integer linear-programming problem is a linear-programming problem with
the additional constraint that the variables x must take on integral values. Exer-
cise 34.5-3 shows that just determining whether an integer linear program has a
feasible solution is NP-hard, which means that there is no known polynomial-time
algorithm for this problem.

a. Show that weak duality (Lemma 29.8) holds for an integer linear program.

b. Show that duality (Theorem 29.10) does not always hold for an integer linear
   program.

c. Given a primal linear program in standard form, let us deﬁne P to be the opti-
   mal objective value for the primal linear program, D to be the optimal objective
   value for its dual, IP to be the optimal objective value for the integer version of
   the primal (that is, the primal with the added constraint that the variables take
   on integer values), and ID to be the optimal objective value for the integer ver-
   sion of the dual. Assuming that both the primal integer program and the dual
   integer program are feasible and bounded, show that
