            4.2-6
            How quickly can you multiply a k n n matrix by an n k n matrix, using Strassen’s
            algorithm as a subroutine? Answer the same question with the order of the input
            matrices reversed.

            4.2-7
            Show how to multiply the complex numbers a C bi and c C d i using only three
            multiplications of real numbers. The algorithm should take a, b, c, and d as input
            and produce the real component ac  bd and the imaginary component ad C bc
            separately.



4.3 The substitution method for solving recurrences

            Now that we have seen how recurrences characterize the running times of divide-
            and-conquer algorithms, we will learn how to solve recurrences. We start in this
            section with the “substitution” method.
              The substitution method for solving recurrences comprises two steps:
            1. Guess the form of the solution.
            2. Use mathematical induction to ﬁnd the constants and show that the solution
               works.
            We substitute the guessed solution for the function when applying the inductive
            hypothesis to smaller values; hence the name “substitution method.” This method
            is powerful, but we must be able to guess the form of the answer in order to apply it.
               We can use the substitution method to establish either upper or lower bounds on
            a recurrence. As an example, let us determine an upper bound on the recurrence
            T .n/ D 2T .bn=2c/ C n ;                                                       (4.19)
            which is similar to recurrences (4.3) and (4.4). We guess that the solution is
            T .n/ D O.n lg n/. The substitution method requires us to prove that T .n/ 
            cn lg n for an appropriate choice of the constant c > 0. We start by assuming
            that this bound holds for all positive m < n, in particular for m D bn=2c, yielding
            T .bn=2c/  c bn=2c lg.bn=2c/. Substituting into the recurrence yields
            T .n/       2.c bn=2c lg.bn=2c// C n
                        cn lg.n=2/ C n
                  D      cn lg n  cn lg 2 C n
                  D      cn lg n  cn C n
                        cn lg n ;
