 Figure 29.2 (a) The linear program given in (29.12)–(29.15). Each constraint is represented by
 a line and a direction. The intersection of the constraints, which is the feasible region, is shaded.
 (b) The dotted lines show, respectively, the points for which the objective value is 0, 4, and 8. The
 optimal solution to the linear program is x1 D 2 and x2 D 6 with objective value 8.


 that the set of feasible solutions (shaded in the ﬁgure) forms a convex region1 in
 the two-dimensional space. We call this convex region the feasible region and the
 function we wish to maximize the objective function. Conceptually, we could eval-
 uate the objective function x1 C x2 at each point in the feasible region; we call the
 value of the objective function at a particular point the objective value. We could
 then identify a point that has the maximum objective value as an optimal solution.
 For this example (and for most linear programs), the feasible region contains an
 inﬁnite number of points, and so we need to determine an efﬁcient way to ﬁnd a
 point that achieves the maximum objective value without explicitly evaluating the
 objective function at every point in the feasible region.
    In two dimensions, we can optimize via a graphical procedure. The set of points
 for which x1 Cx2 D ´, for any ´, is a line with a slope of 1. If we plot x1 Cx2 D 0,
 we obtain the line with slope 1 through the origin, as in Figure 29.2(b). The
 intersection of this line and the feasible region is the set of feasible solutions that
 have an objective value of 0. In this case, that intersection of the line with the
 feasible region is the single point .0; 0/. More generally, for any ´, the intersection


 1 An intuitive deﬁnition of a convex region is that it fulﬁlls the requirement that for any two points in

 the region, all points on a line segment between them are also in the region.
