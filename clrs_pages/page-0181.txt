160   Chapter 6 Heapsort


      by exchanging it with AŒn. If we now discard node n from the heap—and we
      can do so by simply decrementing A:heap-size—we observe that the children of
      the root remain max-heaps, but the new root element might violate the max-heap
      property. All we need to do to restore the max-heap property, however, is call
      M AX -H EAPIFY .A; 1/, which leaves a max-heap in AŒ1 : : n  1. The heapsort
      algorithm then repeats this process for the max-heap of size n  1 down to a heap
      of size 2. (See Exercise 6.4-2 for a precise loop invariant.)

      Figure 6.4 shows an example of the operation of H EAPSORT after line 1 has built
      the initial max-heap. The ﬁgure shows the max-heap before the ﬁrst iteration of
      the for loop of lines 2–5 and after each iteration.
         The H EAPSORT procedure takes time O.n lg n/, since the call to B UILD -M AX -
      H EAP takes time O.n/ and each of the n  1 calls to M AX -H EAPIFY takes
      time O.lg n/.

      Exercises

      6.4-1
      Using Figure 6.4 as a model, illustrate the operation of H EAPSORT on the array
      A D h5; 13; 2; 25; 7; 17; 20; 8; 4i.

      6.4-2
      Argue the correctness of H EAPSORT using the following loop invariant:

         At the start of each iteration of the for loop of lines 2–5, the subarray
         AŒ1 : : i is a max-heap containing the i smallest elements of AŒ1 : : n, and
         the subarray AŒi C 1 : : n contains the n  i largest elements of AŒ1 : : n,
         sorted.

      6.4-3
      What is the running time of H EAPSORT on an array A of length n that is already
      sorted in increasing order? What about decreasing order?

      6.4-4
      Show that the worst-case running time of H EAPSORT is .n lg n/.
