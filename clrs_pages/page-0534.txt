As Figure 19.4 illustrates, F IB -H EAP -E XTRACT-M IN works by ﬁrst making a root
out of each of the minimum node’s children and removing the minimum node from
the root list. It then consolidates the root list by linking roots of equal degree until
at most one root remains of each degree.
   We start in line 1 by saving a pointer ´ to the minimum node; the procedure
returns this pointer at the end. If ´ is NIL, then Fibonacci heap H is already empty
and we are done. Otherwise, we delete node ´ from H by making all of ´’s chil-
dren roots of H in lines 3–5 (putting them into the root list) and removing ´ from
the root list in line 6. If ´ is its own right sibling after line 6, then ´ was the
only node on the root list and it had no children, so all that remains is to make
the Fibonacci heap empty in line 8 before returning ´. Otherwise, we set the
pointer H:min into the root list to point to a root other than ´ (in this case, ´’s
right sibling), which is not necessarily going to be the new minimum node when
F IB -H EAP -E XTRACT-M IN is done. Figure 19.4(b) shows the Fibonacci heap of
Figure 19.4(a) after executing line 9.
   The next step, in which we reduce the number of trees in the Fibonacci heap, is
consolidating the root list of H , which the call C ONSOLIDATE .H / accomplishes.
Consolidating the root list consists of repeatedly executing the following steps until
every root in the root list has a distinct degree value:
1. Find two roots x and y in the root list with the same degree. Without loss of
   generality, let x:key  y:key.
2. Link y to x: remove y from the root list, and make y a child of x by calling the
   F IB -H EAP -L INK procedure. This procedure increments the attribute x:degree
   and clears the mark on y.
