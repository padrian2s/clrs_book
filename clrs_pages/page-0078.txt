3.2 Standard notations and common functions                                     57


   By equation (3.15), changing the base of a logarithm from one constant to an-
other changes the value of the logarithm by only a constant factor, and so we shall
often use the notation “lg n” when we don’t care about constant factors, such as in
O-notation. Computer scientists ﬁnd 2 to be the most natural base for logarithms
because so many algorithms and data structures involve splitting a problem into
two parts.
   There is a simple series expansion for ln.1 C x/ when jxj < 1:
                   x2   x3 x4   x5
ln.1 C x/ D x        C      C      :
                   2    3   4   5
We also have the following inequalities for x > 1:
 x
        ln.1 C x/  x ;                                                    (3.17)
1Cx
where equality holds only for x D 0.
   We say that a function f .n/ is polylogarithmically bounded if f .n/ D O.lgk n/
for some constant k. We can relate the growth of polynomials and polylogarithms
by substituting lg n for n and 2a for a in equation (3.10), yielding
     lgb n           lgb n
lim           D  lim       D0:
n!1 .2a /lg n   n!1 na

From this limit, we can conclude that
lgb n D o.na /
for any constant a > 0. Thus, any positive polynomial function grows faster than
any polylogarithmic function.

Factorials
The notation nŠ (read “n factorial”) is deﬁned for integers n  0 as
     (
       1             if n D 0 ;
nŠ D
       n  .n  1/Š if n > 0 :

Thus, nŠ D 1  2  3    n.
   A weak upper bound on the factorial function is nŠ  nn , since each of the n
terms in the factorial product is at most n. Stirling’s approximation,
