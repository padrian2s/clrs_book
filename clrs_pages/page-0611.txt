           shortest-paths algorithms presented in Chapter 25 assume that their input graphs
           are represented by adjacency matrices.
              The adjacency-list representation of a graph G D .V; E/ consists of an ar-
           ray Adj of jV j lists, one for each vertex in V . For each u 2 V , the adjacency list
           Adjﾅ置 contains all the vertices  such that there is an edge .u; / 2 E. That is,
           Adjﾅ置 consists of all the vertices adjacent to u in G. (Alternatively, it may contain
           pointers to these vertices.) Since the adjacency lists represent the edges of a graph,
           in pseudocode we treat the array Adj as an attribute of the graph, just as we treat
           the edge set E. In pseudocode, therefore, we will see notation such as G:Adjﾅ置.
           Figure 22.1(b) is an adjacency-list representation of the undirected graph in Fig-
           ure 22.1(a). Similarly, Figure 22.2(b) is an adjacency-list representation of the
           directed graph in Figure 22.2(a).
              If G is a directed graph, the sum of the lengths of all the adjacency lists is jEj,
           since an edge of the form .u; / is represented by having  appear in Adjﾅ置. If G is
