1162   Appendix B    Sets, Etc.


         The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted A B, is the set of all
       ordered pairs such that the ﬁrst element of the pair is an element of A and the
       second is an element of B. More formally,
       A     B D f.a; b/ W a 2 A and b 2 Bg :
       For example, fa; bg fa; b; cg D f.a; a/; .a; b/; .a; c/; .b; a/; .b; b/; .b; c/g. When
       A and B are ﬁnite sets, the cardinality of their Cartesian product is
       jA     Bj D jAj  jBj :                                                                   (B.4)
           The Cartesian product of n sets A1 ; A2 ; : : : ; An is the set of n-tuples
       A1     A2         An D f.a1 ; a2 ; : : : ; an / W ai 2 Ai for i D 1; 2; : : : ; ng ;
       whose cardinality is
       jA1     A2         An j D jA1 j  jA2 j    jAn j
       if all sets are ﬁnite. We denote an n-fold Cartesian product over a single set A by
       the set
       An D A       A          A;
       whose cardinality is jAn j D jAjn if A is ﬁnite. We can also view an n-tuple as a
       ﬁnite sequence of length n (see page 1166).
