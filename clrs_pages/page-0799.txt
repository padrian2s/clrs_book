      Figure 27.2 A directed acyclic graph representing the computation of P-F IB.4/. Each circle rep-
      resents one strand, with black circles representing either base cases or the part of the procedure
      (instance) up to the spawn of P-F IB.n  1/ in line 3, shaded circles representing the part of the pro-
      cedure that calls P-F IB.n  2/ in line 4 up to the sync in line 5, where it suspends until the spawn of
      P-F IB.n  1/ returns, and white circles representing the part of the procedure after the sync where
      it sums x and y up to the point where it returns the result. Each group of strands belonging to the
      same procedure is surrounded by a rounded rectangle, lightly shaded for spawned procedures and
      heavily shaded for called procedures. Spawn edges and call edges point downward, continuation
      edges point horizontally to the right, and return edges point upward. Assuming that each strand takes
      unit time, the work equals 17 time units, since there are 17 strands, and the span is 8 time units, since
      the critical path—shown with shaded edges—contains 8 strands.


      If G has a directed path from strand u to strand , we say that the two strands are
      (logically) in series. Otherwise, strands u and  are (logically) in parallel.
         We can picture a multithreaded computation as a dag of strands embedded in a
      tree of procedure instances. For example, Figure 27.1 shows the tree of procedure
      instances for P-F IB .6/ without the detailed structure showing strands. Figure 27.2
      zooms in on a section of that tree, showing the strands that constitute each proce-
      dure. All directed edges connecting strands run either within a procedure or along
      undirected edges in the procedure tree.
         We can classify the edges of a computation dag to indicate the kind of dependen-
      cies between the various strands. A continuation edge .u; u0 /, drawn horizontally
      in Figure 27.2, connects a strand u to its successor u0 within the same procedure
      instance. When a strand u spawns a strand , the dag contains a spawn edge .u; /,
      which points downward in the ﬁgure. Call edges, representing normal procedure
      calls, also point downward. Strand u spawning strand  differs from u calling 
      in that a spawn induces a horizontal continuation edge from u to the strand u0 fol-
