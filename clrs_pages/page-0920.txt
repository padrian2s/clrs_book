mial C.x/, also of degree-bound n, such that C.x/ D A.x/ C B.x/ for all x in the
underlying ﬁeld. That is, if
         X
         n1
A.x/ D          aj x j
         j D0

and
         X
         n1
B.x/ D          bj x j ;
         j D0

then
         X
         n1
C.x/ D          cj x j ;
         j D0

where cj D aj C bj for j D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1. For example, if we have the
polynomials A.x/ D 6x 3 C 7x 2  10x C 9 and B.x/ D 2x 3 C 4x  5, then
C.x/ D 4x 3 C 7x 2  6x C 4.
   For polynomial multiplication, if A.x/ and B.x/ are polynomials of degree-
bound n, their product C.x/ is a polynomial of degree-bound 2n  1 such that
C.x/ D A.x/B.x/ for all x in the underlying ﬁeld. You probably have multi-
plied polynomials before, by multiplying each term in A.x/ by each term in B.x/
and then combining terms with equal powers. For example, we can multiply
A.x/ D 6x 3 C 7x 2  10x C 9 and B.x/ D 2x 3 C 4x  5 as follows:
                           6x 3 C 7x 2  10x C 9
                         2x 3          C 4x  5
                              3       2
                         30x  35x C 50x  45
                  24x 4 C 28x 3  40x 2 C 36x
 12x 6  14x 5 C 20x 4  18x 3
 12x 6  14x 5 C 44x 4  20x 3  75x 2 C 86x  45
Another way to express the product C.x/ is
         X
         2n2
C.x/ D           cj x j ;                                                 (30.1)
