           Notes for Chapter 22                                                             623


           22-3 Euler tour
           An Euler tour of a strongly connected, directed graph G D .V; E/ is a cycle that
           traverses each edge of G exactly once, although it may visit a vertex more than
           once.

           a. Show that G has an Euler tour if and only if in-degree./ D out-degree./ for
              each vertex  2 V .

           b. Describe an O.E/-time algorithm to ﬁnd an Euler tour of G if one exists. (Hint:
              Merge edge-disjoint cycles.)

           22-4 Reachability
           Let G D .V; E/ be a directed graph in which each vertex u 2 V is labeled with
           a unique integer L.u/ from the set f1; 2; : : : ; jV jg. For each vertex u 2 V , let
           R.u/ D f 2 V W u ; g be the set of vertices that are reachable from u. Deﬁne
           min.u/ to be the vertex in R.u/ whose label is minimum, i.e., min.u/ is the vertex 
           such that L./ D min fL.w/ W w 2 R.u/g. Give an O.V C E/-time algorithm that
           computes min.u/ for all vertices u 2 V .


Chapter notes

           Even [103] and Tarjan [330] are excellent references for graph algorithms.
              Breadth-ﬁrst search was discovered by Moore [260] in the context of ﬁnding
           paths through mazes. Lee [226] independently discovered the same algorithm in
           the context of routing wires on circuit boards.
              Hopcroft and Tarjan [178] advocated the use of the adjacency-list representation
           over the adjacency-matrix representation for sparse graphs and were the ﬁrst to
           recognize the algorithmic importance of depth-ﬁrst search. Depth-ﬁrst search has
           been widely used since the late 1950s, especially in artiﬁcial intelligence programs.
              Tarjan [327] gave a linear-time algorithm for ﬁnding strongly connected compo-
           nents. The algorithm for strongly connected components in Section 22.5 is adapted
           from Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman [6], who credit it to S. R. Kosaraju (unpublished)
           and M. Sharir [314]. Gabow [119] also developed an algorithm for strongly con-
           nected components that is based on contracting cycles and uses two stacks to make
           it run in linear time. Knuth [209] was the ﬁrst to give a linear-time algorithm for
           topological sorting.
