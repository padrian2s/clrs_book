878   Chapter 29 Linear Programming


      Lemma 29.7
      Assuming that I NITIALIZE -S IMPLEX returns a slack form for which the basic so-
      lution is feasible, S IMPLEX either reports that a linear program is unbounded, or it
      terminates with a feasible solution in at most nCmm
                                                             iterations.

      Proof Lemmas 29.2 and 29.6 show that if I NITIALIZE -S IMPLEX returns a slack
      form for which the basic solution is feasible, S IMPLEX either reports that a linear
      program is unbounded, or it terminates with a feasible solution. By the contra-
      positive of Lemma 29.5, if S IMPLEX terminates with a feasible solution, then it
      terminates in at most nCm
                             m
                                 iterations.

      Prove that the slack form given to the P IVOT procedure and the slack form that the
      procedure returns are equivalent.
