984   Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms


      Goldwasser, Micali, and Rivest [143] present a digital-signature scheme for which
      every conceivable type of forgery is provably as difﬁcult as factoring. Menezes,
      van Oorschot, and Vanstone [254] provide an overview of applied cryptography.
         The rho heuristic for integer factorization was invented by Pollard [277]. The
      version presented here is a variant proposed by Brent [56].
         The best algorithms for factoring large numbers have a running time that grows
      roughly exponentially with the cube root of the length of the number n to be fac-
      tored. The general number-ﬁeld sieve factoring algorithm (as developed by Buh-
      ler, Lenstra, and Pomerance [57] as an extension of the ideas in the number-ﬁeld
      sieve factoring algorithm by Pollard [278] and Lenstra et al. [232] and reﬁned by
      Coppersmith [77] and others) is perhaps the most efﬁcient such algorithm in gen-
      eral for large inputs. Although it is difﬁcult to give a rigorous analysis of this
      algorithm, under reasonable assumptions we can derive a running-time estimate of
                                                    ˛         1˛
      L.1=3; n/1:902Co.1/ , where L.˛; n/ D e .ln n/ .ln ln n/ .
         The elliptic-curve method due to Lenstra [233] may be more effective for some
      inputs than the number-ﬁeld sieve method, since, like Pollard’s rho method, it can
      ﬁnd a small prime factor pp quite quickly. With this method, the time to ﬁnd p is
      estimated to be L.1=2; p/ 2Co.1/ .
