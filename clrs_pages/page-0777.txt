      Figure 26.10 The action of R ELABEL -T O -F RONT . (a) A ﬂow network just before the ﬁrst iteration
      of the while loop. Initially, 26 units of ﬂow leave source s. On the right is shown the initial list
      L D hx; y; ´i, where initially u D x. Under each vertex in list L is its neighbor list, with the current
      neighbor shaded. Vertex x is discharged. It is relabeled to height 1, 5 units of excess ﬂow are pushed
      to y, and the 7 remaining units of excess are pushed to the sink t. Because x is relabeled, it moves
      to the head of L, which in this case does not change the structure of L. (b) After x, the next vertex
      in L that is discharged is y. Figure 26.9 shows the detailed action of discharging y in this situation.
      Because y is relabeled, it is moved to the head of L. (c) Vertex x now follows y in L, and so it is
      again discharged, pushing all 5 units of excess ﬂow to t. Because vertex x is not relabeled in this
      discharge operation, it remains in place in list L.
