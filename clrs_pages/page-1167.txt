       lim          ak :

              kD1

       If the limit does not exist, the series diverges; otherwise, it converges. The terms
       of a convergent series cannot always be added in any order. We can, P       however,
                                                                                     1
       rearrange the terms Pof an absolutely convergent series, that is, a series kD1 ak

       for which the series kD1 jak j also converges.

       Linearity

       kD1                     kD1          kD1

       The linearity property also applies to inﬁnite convergent series.
          We can exploit the linearity property to manipulate summations incorporating
       asymptotic notation. For example,
                                     !
       Xn                   Xn
           ‚.f .k// D ‚         f .k/ :
       kD1                     kD1

       In this equation, the ‚-notation on the left-hand side applies to the variable k, but
       on the right-hand side, it applies to n. We can also apply such manipulations to
       inﬁnite convergent series.

       The summation

       is an arithmetic series and has the value
