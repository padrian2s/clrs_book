           B.5-2
           Let G D .V; E/ be a directed acyclic graph in which there is a vertex 0 2 V
           such that there exists a unique path from 0 to every vertex  2 V . Prove that the
           undirected version of G forms a tree.

           B.5-3
           Show by induction that the number of degree-2 nodes in any nonempty binary tree
           is 1 fewer than the number of leaves. Conclude that the number of internal nodes
           in a full binary tree is 1 fewer than the number of leaves.

           B.5-4
           Use induction to show that a nonempty binary tree with n nodes has height at
           least blg nc.

           B.5-5 ?
           The internal path length of a full binary tree is the sum, taken over all internal
           nodes of the tree, of the depth of each node. Likewise, the external path length is
           the sum, taken over all leaves of the tree, of the depth of each leaf. Consider a full
           binary tree with n internal nodes, internal path length i, and external path length e.
           Prove that e D i C 2n.

           B.5-6 ?
           Let us associate a “weight” w.x/ D 2d with each leafPx of depth d in a binary
           tree T , and let L be the set of leaves of T . Prove that x2L w.x/  1. (This is
           known as the Kraft inequality.)

           B.5-7 ?
           Show that if L  2, then every binary tree with L leaves contains a subtree having
           between L=3 and 2L=3 leaves, inclusive.

           B-1 Graph coloring
           Given an undirected graph G D .V; E/, a k-coloring of G is a function c W V !
           f0; 1; : : : ; k  1g such that c.u/ ¤ c./ for every edge .u; / 2 E. In other words,
           the numbers 0; 1; : : : ; k  1 represent the k colors, and adjacent vertices must have
           different colors.

           a. Show that any tree is 2-colorable.
