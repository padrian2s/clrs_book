D.1 Matrices and matrix operations                                                1221


We use the negative of a matrix to deﬁne matrix subtraction: A  B D A C .B/.
   We deﬁne matrix multiplication as follows. We start with two matrices A and B
that are compatible in the sense that the number of columns of A equals the number
of rows of B. (In general, an expression containing a matrix product AB is always
assumed to imply that matrices A and B are compatible.) If A D .ai k / is an m n
matrix and B D .bkj / is an n p matrix, then their matrix product C D AB is the
m p matrix C D .cij /, where

M ULTIPLY in Section 4.2 implements matrix multiplication in the straightfor-
ward manner based on equation (D.2), assuming that the matrices are square:
m D n D p. To multiply n n matrices, S QUARE -M ATRIX -M ULTIPLY per-
forms n3 multiplications and n2 .n  1/ additions, and so its running time is ‚.n3 /.
   Matrices have many (but not all) of the algebraic properties typical of numbers.
Identity matrices are identities for matrix multiplication:
Im A D AIn D A
for any m        n matrix A. Multiplying by a zero matrix gives a zero matrix:
A0 D 0 :
Matrix multiplication is associative:
A.BC / D .AB/C
for compatible matrices A, B, and C . Matrix multiplication distributes over addi-
tion:
A.B C C / D AB C AC ;
.B C C /D D BD C CD :
For n> 1, multiplication
                       of n n matrices is not commutative. For example, if
       0 1                0 0
AD            and B D          , then
       0 0                1 0
