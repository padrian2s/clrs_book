      Procedure LUP-S OLVE solves for y using forward substitution in lines 3–4, and
      then it solves for x using backward substitution in lines 5–6. Since the summation
      within each of the for loops includes an implicit loop, the running time is ‚.n2 /.
         As an example of these methods, consider the system of linear equations deﬁned
