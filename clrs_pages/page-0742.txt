Figure 26.5 A cut .S; T / in the ﬂow network of Figure 26.1(b), where S D fs; 1 ; 2 g and
T D f3 ; 4 ; tg. The vertices in S are black, and the vertices in T are white. The net ﬂow
across .S; T / is f .S; T / D 19, and the capacity is c.S; T / D 26.


The capacity of the cut .S; T / is
           XX
c.S; T / D         c.u; / :                                                       (26.10)

A minimum cut of a network is a cut whose capacity is minimum over all cuts of
the network.
   The asymmetry between the deﬁnitions of ﬂow and capacity of a cut is inten-
tional and important. For capacity, we count only the capacities of edges going
from S to T , ignoring edges in the reverse direction. For ﬂow, we consider the
ﬂow going from S to T minus the ﬂow going in the reverse direction from T to S.
The reason for this difference will become clear later in this section.
   Figure 26.5 shows the cut .fs; 1 ; 2 g ; f3 ; 4 ; tg/ in the ﬂow network of Fig-
ure 26.1(b). The net ﬂow across this cut is
f .1 ; 3 / C f .2 ; 4 /  f .3 ; 2 / D 12 C 11  4
                                           D 19 ;
and the capacity of this cut is
c.1 ; 3 / C c.2 ; 4 / D 12 C 14
                          D 26 :
   The following lemma shows that, for a given ﬂow f , the net ﬂow across any cut
is the same, and it equals jf j, the value of the ﬂow.

Lemma 26.4
Let f be a ﬂow in a ﬂow network G with source s and sink t, and let .S; T / be any
cut of G. Then the net ﬂow across .S; T / is f .S; T / D jf j.
