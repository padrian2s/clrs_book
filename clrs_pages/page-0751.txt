730   Chapter 26 Maximum Flow


      the entire execution of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm is O.VE/. Each augmenting
      path has at least one critical edge, and hence the theorem follows.

         Because we can implement each iteration of F ORD -F ULKERSON in O.E/ time
      when we ﬁnd the augmenting path by breadth-ﬁrst search, the total running time of
      the Edmonds-Karp algorithm is O.VE 2 /. We shall see that push-relabel algorithms
      can yield even better bounds. The algorithm of Section 26.4 gives a method for
      achieving an O.V 2 E/ running time, which forms the basis for the O.V 3 /-time
      algorithm of Section 26.5.

      Prove that the summations in equation (26.6) equal the summations in equa-
      tion (26.7).

      26.2-2
      In Figure 26.1(b), what is the ﬂow across the cut .fs; 2 ; 4 g ; f1 ; 3 ; tg/? What is
      the capacity of this cut?

      26.2-3
      Show the execution of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm on the ﬂow network of Fig-
      ure 26.1(a).

      26.2-4
      In the example of Figure 26.6, what is the minimum cut corresponding to the max-
      imum ﬂow shown? Of the augmenting paths appearing in the example, which one
      cancels ﬂow?

      26.2-5
      Recall that the construction in Section 26.1 that converts a ﬂow network with mul-
      tiple sources and sinks into a single-source, single-sink network adds edges with
      inﬁnite capacity. Prove that any ﬂow in the resulting network has a ﬁnite value
      if the edges of the original network with multiple sources and sinks have ﬁnite
      capacity.

      26.2-6
      Suppose that each source si in a ﬂow network P with multiple sources and sinks
      produces exactly pi units of ﬂow, so that 2V f .sP     i ; / D pi . Suppose also

      P    each  sink
