The procedure returns the rank 17.
   Since each iteration of the while loop takes O.1/ time, and y goes up one level in
the tree with each iteration, the running time of OS-R ANK is at worst proportional
to the height of the tree: O.lg n/ on an n-node order-statistic tree.

Maintaining subtree sizes
Given the size attribute in each node, OS-S ELECT and OS-R ANK can quickly
compute order-statistic information. But unless we can efﬁciently maintain these
attributes within the basic modifying operations on red-black trees, our work will
have been for naught. We shall now show how to maintain subtree sizes for both
insertion and deletion without affecting the asymptotic running time of either op-
eration.
   We noted in Section 13.3 that insertion into a red-black tree consists of two
phases. The ﬁrst phase goes down the tree from the root, inserting the new node
as a child of an existing node. The second phase goes up the tree, changing colors
and performing rotations to maintain the red-black properties.
   To maintain the subtree sizes in the ﬁrst phase, we simply increment x:size for
each node x on the simple path traversed from the root down toward the leaves. The
new node added gets a size of 1. Since there are O.lg n/ nodes on the traversed
path, the additional cost of maintaining the size attributes is O.lg n/.
   In the second phase, the only structural changes to the underlying red-black tree
are caused by rotations, of which there are at most two. Moreover, a rotation is
a local operation: only two nodes have their size attributes invalidated. The link
around which the rotation is performed is incident on these two nodes. Referring
to the code for L EFT-ROTATE .T; x/ in Section 13.2, we add the following lines:

13   y:size D x:size
14   x:size D x:left:size C x:right:size C 1
Figure 14.2 illustrates how the attributes are updated. The change to R IGHT-
ROTATE is symmetric.
   Since at most two rotations are performed during insertion into a red-black tree,
we spend only O.1/ additional time updating size attributes in the second phase.
Thus, the total time for insertion into an n-node order-statistic tree is O.lg n/,
which is asymptotically the same as for an ordinary red-black tree.
   Deletion from a red-black tree also consists of two phases: the ﬁrst operates
on the underlying search tree, and the second causes at most three rotations and
otherwise performs no structural changes. (See Section 13.4.) The ﬁrst phase
either removes one node y from the tree or moves upward it within the tree. To
update the subtree sizes, we simply traverse a simple path from node y (starting
from its original position within the tree) up to the root, decrementing the size
