           27.1-6
           Give a multithreaded algorithm to multiply an n n matrix by an n-vector that
           achieves ‚.n2 = lg n/ parallelism while maintaining ‚.n2 / work.

           27.1-7
           Consider the following multithreaded pseudocode for transposing an n n matrix A
           in place:

           P-T RANSPOSE .A/
           1 n D A:rows
           2 parallel for j D 2 to n
           3      parallel for i D 1 to j  1
           4          exchange aij with aj i

           Analyze the work, span, and parallelism of this algorithm.

           27.1-8
           Suppose that we replace the parallel for loop in line 3 of P-T RANSPOSE (see Ex-
           ercise 27.1-7) with an ordinary for loop. Analyze the work, span, and parallelism
           of the resulting algorithm.

           27.1-9
           For how many processors do the two versions of the chess programs run equally
           fast, assuming that TP D T1 =P C T1 ?



27.2 Multithreaded matrix multiplication

           In this section, we examine how to multithread matrix multiplication, a problem
           whose serial running time we studied in Section 4.2. We’ll look at multithreaded
           algorithms based on the standard triply nested loop, as well as divide-and-conquer
           algorithms.

           Multithreaded matrix multiplication
           The ﬁrst algorithm we study is the straighforward algorithm based on parallelizing
           the loops in the procedure S QUARE -M ATRIX -M ULTIPLY on page 75:
