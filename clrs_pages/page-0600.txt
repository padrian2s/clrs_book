21.4 Analysis of union by rank with path compression                                579


is unchanged and iter.x/ increases, then it increases by at least 1, and so
q .x/  q1 .x/  1.
   Finally, if the qth operation increases level.x/, it increases by at least 1, so that
the value of the term .˛.n/  level.x//  x:rank drops by at least x:rank. Be-
cause level.x/ increased, the value of iter.x/ might drop, but according to the
bound (21.2), the drop is by at most x:rank  1. Thus, the increase in poten-
tial due to the change in iter.x/ is less than the decrease in potential due to the
change in level.x/, and we conclude that q .x/  q1 .x/  1.

   Our ﬁnal three lemmas show that the amortized cost of each M AKE -S ET, L INK,
and F IND -S ET operation is O.˛.n//. Recall from equation (17.2) that the amor-
tized cost of each operation is its actual cost plus the increase in potential due to
the operation.

Lemma 21.11
The amortized cost of each M AKE -S ET operation is O.1/.

Proof Suppose that the qth operation is M AKE -S ET .x/. This operation creates
node x with rank 0, so that q .x/ D 0. No other ranks or potentials change, and
so ˆq D ˆq1 . Noting that the actual cost of the M AKE -S ET operation is O.1/
completes the proof.

Lemma 21.12
The amortized cost of each L INK operation is O.˛.n//.

Proof Suppose that the qth operation is L INK .x; y/. The actual cost of the L INK
operation is O.1/. Without loss of generality, suppose that the L INK makes y the
parent of x.
   To determine the change in potential due to the L INK, we note that the only
nodes whose potentials may change are x, y, and the children of y just prior to the
operation. We shall show that the only node whose potential can increase due to
the L INK is y, and that its increase is at most ˛.n/:
   By Lemma 21.10, any node that is y’s child just before the L INK cannot have
    its potential increase due to the L INK.
   From the deﬁnition of q .x/, we see that, since x was a root just before the qth
    operation, q1 .x/ D ˛.n/x:rank. If x:rank D 0, then q .x/ D q1 .x/ D 0.
    Otherwise,
    q .x/ < ˛.n/  x:rank (by Corollary 21.9)
           D q1 .x/ ;
    and so x’s potential decreases.
