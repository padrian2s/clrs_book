276   Chapter 11 Hash Tables


      Proof An element is inserted only if there is room in the table, and thus ˛ < 1.
      Inserting a key requires an unsuccessful search followed by placing the key into the
      ﬁrst empty slot found. Thus, the expected number of probes is at most 1=.1˛/.

         We have to do a little more work to compute the expected number of probes for
      a successful search.

      Theorem 11.8
      Given an open-address hash table with load factor ˛ < 1, the expected number of
      probes in a successful search is at most
       1      1
         ln       ;
      ˛ 1˛
      assuming uniform hashing and assuming that each key in the table is equally likely
      to be searched for.

      Proof A search for a key k reproduces the same probe sequence as when the
      element with key k was inserted. By Corollary 11.7, if k was the .i C 1/st key
      inserted into the hash table, the expected number of probes made in a search for k
      is at most 1=.1  i=m/ D m=.m  i/. Averaging over all n keys in the hash table
      gives us the expected number of probes in a successful search:

      1X m                mX 1
        n1                    n1
                     D
      n i D0 m  i        n i D0 m  i
                          1      X
                                 m
                                         1
                     D
                          ˛              k
                               kDmnC1
                            Z
                          1 m
                               .1=x/ dx (by inequality (A.12))
                          ˛ mn
                          1    m
                     D      ln
                          ˛ mn
                          1    1
                     D      ln     :
                          ˛ 1˛

         If the hash table is half full, the expected number of probes in a successful search
      is less than 1:387. If the hash table is 90 percent full, the expected number of probes
      is less than 2:559.
