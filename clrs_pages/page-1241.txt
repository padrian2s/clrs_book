       6. A permutation matrix P has exactly one 1 in each row or column, and 0s
          elsewhere. An example of a permutation matrix is
                ˇ0 1 0 0 0
                    0    0     0   1   0
          P D       1    0     0   0   0   :
                    0    0     0   0   1
                    0    0     1   0   0

          Such a matrix is called a permutation matrix because multiplying a vector x
          by a permutation matrix has the effect of permuting (rearranging) the elements
          of x. Exercise D.1-4 explores additional properties of permutation matrices.
       7. A symmetric matrix A satisﬁes the condition A D AT . For example,
          1 2 3
             2 6 4
             3 4 5

          is a symmetric matrix.

       Basic matrix operations
       The elements of a matrix or vector are numbers from a number system, such as
       the real numbers, the complex numbers, or integers modulo a prime. The number
       system deﬁnes how to add and multiply numbers. We can extend these deﬁnitions
       to encompass addition and multiplication of matrices.
          We deﬁne matrix addition as follows. If A D .aij / and B D .bij / are m n
       matrices, then their matrix sum C D .cij / D A C B is the m n matrix deﬁned by
       cij D aij C bij
       for i D 1; 2; : : : ; m and j D 1; 2; : : : ; n. That is, matrix addition is performed
       componentwise. A zero matrix is the identity for matrix addition:
       AC0 DAD 0CA:
         If  is a number and A D .aij / is a matrix, then A D .aij / is the scalar
       multiple of A obtained by multiplying each of its elements by . As a special case,
       we deﬁne the negative of a matrix A D .aij / to be 1  A D A, so that the ij th
       entry of A is aij . Thus,
       A C .A/ D 0 D .A/ C A :
