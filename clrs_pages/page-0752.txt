26.2 The Ford-Fulkerson method                                                 731


these additional constraints into the problem of ﬁnding a maximum ﬂow in a single-
source, single-sink ﬂow network.

26.2-7
Prove Lemma 26.2.

26.2-8
Suppose that we redeﬁne the residual network to disallow edges into s. Argue that
the procedure F ORD -F ULKERSON still correctly computes a maximum ﬂow.

26.2-9
Suppose that both f and f 0 are ﬂows in a network G and we compute ﬂow f " f 0 .
Does the augmented ﬂow satisfy the ﬂow conservation property? Does it satisfy
the capacity constraint?

26.2-10
Show how to ﬁnd a maximum ﬂow in a network G D .V; E/ by a sequence of at
most jEj augmenting paths. (Hint: Determine the paths after ﬁnding the maximum
ﬂow.)

26.2-11
The edge connectivity of an undirected graph is the minimum number k of edges
that must be removed to disconnect the graph. For example, the edge connectivity
of a tree is 1, and the edge connectivity of a cyclic chain of vertices is 2. Show
how to determine the edge connectivity of an undirected graph G D .V; E/ by
running a maximum-ﬂow algorithm on at most jV j ﬂow networks, each having
O.V / vertices and O.E/ edges.

26.2-12
Suppose that you are given a ﬂow network G, and G has edges entering the
source s. Let f be a ﬂow in G in which one of the edges .; s/ entering the source
has f .; s/ D 1. Prove that there must exist another ﬂow f 0 with f 0 .; s/ D 0
such that jf j D jf 0 j. Give an O.E/-time algorithm to compute f 0 , given f , and
assuming that all edge capacities are integers.

26.2-13
Suppose that you wish to ﬁnd, among all minimum cuts in a ﬂow network G with
integral capacities, one that contains the smallest number of edges. Show how to
modify the capacities of G to create a new ﬂow network G 0 in which any minimum
cut in G 0 is a minimum cut with the smallest number of edges in G.
