29.5 The initial basic feasible solution                                         891


that after this pivot, all entries of b are nonnegative, and hence the basic solution
to Laux is feasible. Letting xN be the basic solution after the call to P IVOT, and
letting by and By be values returned by P IVOT, Lemma 29.1 implies that

(Note that ai 0 is the coefﬁcient of x0 as it appears in inequalities (29.114), not
the negation of the coefﬁcient, because Laux is in standard rather than slack form.)
Since l 2 B, we also have that ale D 1. Thus, bl =ale > 0, and so xN e > 0. For
the remaining basic variables, we have

xN i   D    bi  ai e bye          (by equation (29.113))
       D    bi  ai e .bl =ale /   (by line 3 of P IVOT)
       D    bi  bl                (by equation (29.115) and ale D 1)
           0                      (by inequality (29.112)) ,
which implies that each basic variable is now nonnegative. Hence the basic solu-
tion after the call to P IVOT in line 8 is feasible. We next execute line 10, which
solves Laux . Since we have assumed that L has a feasible solution, Lemma 29.11
implies that Laux has an optimal solution with objective value 0. Since all the slack
forms are equivalent, the ﬁnal basic solution to Laux must have xN 0 D 0, and after
removing x0 from the linear program, we obtain a slack form that is feasible for L.
Line 15 then returns this slack form.

Fundamental theorem of linear programming
We conclude this chapter by showing that the S IMPLEX procedure works. In par-
ticular, any linear program either is infeasible, is unbounded, or has an optimal
solution with a ﬁnite objective value. In each case, S IMPLEX acts appropriately.
