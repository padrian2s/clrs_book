      This system has the associated basic solution .33=4; 0; 3=2; 69=4; 0; 0/, with ob-
      jective value 111=4. Now the only way to increase the objective value is to in-
      crease x2 . The three constraints give upper bounds of 132, 4, and 1, respectively.
      (We get an upper bound of 1 from constraint (29.71) because, as we increase x2 ,
      the value of the basic variable x4 increases also. This constraint, therefore, places
      no restriction on how much we can increase x2 .) We increase x2 to 4, and it be-
      comes nonbasic. Then we solve equation (29.70) for x2 and substitute in the other
      equations to obtain

      At this point, all coefﬁcients in the objective function are negative. As we shall see
      later in this chapter, this situation occurs only when we have rewritten the linear
      program so that the basic solution is an optimal solution. Thus, for this problem,
      the solution .8; 4; 0; 18; 0; 0/, with objective value 28, is optimal. We can now
      return to our original linear program given in (29.53)–(29.57). The only variables
      in the original linear program are x1 , x2 , and x3 , and so our solution is x1 D 8,
      x2 D 4, and x3 D 0, with objective value .3  8/ C .1  4/ C .2  0/ D 28. Note
      that the values of the slack variables in the ﬁnal solution measure how much slack
      remains in each inequality. Slack variable x4 is 18, and in inequality (29.54), the
      left-hand side, with value 8 C 4 C 0 D 12, is 18 less than the right-hand side of 30.
      Slack variables x5 and x6 are 0 and indeed, in inequalities (29.55) and (29.56),
      the left-hand and right-hand sides are equal. Observe also that even though the
      coefﬁcients in the original slack form are integral, the coefﬁcients in the other
      linear programs are not necessarily integral, and the intermediate solutions are not
