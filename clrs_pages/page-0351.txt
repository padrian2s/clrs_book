330   Chapter 13 Red-Black Trees


      Exercises

      13.4-1
      Argue that after executing RB-D ELETE -F IXUP, the root of the tree must be black.

      13.4-2
      Argue that if in RB-D ELETE both x and x:p are red, then property 4 is restored by
      the call to RB-D ELETE -F IXUP .T; x/.

      13.4-3
      In Exercise 13.3-2, you found the red-black tree that results from successively
      inserting the keys 41; 38; 31; 12; 19; 8 into an initially empty tree. Now show the
      red-black trees that result from the successive deletion of the keys in the order
      8; 12; 19; 31; 38; 41.

      13.4-4
      In which lines of the code for RB-D ELETE -F IXUP might we examine or modify
      the sentinel T:nil?

      13.4-5
      In each of the cases of Figure 13.7, give the count of black nodes from the root of
      the subtree shown to each of the subtrees ˛; ˇ; : : : ; , and verify that each count
      remains the same after the transformation. When a node has a color attribute c
      or c 0 , use the notation count.c/ or count.c 0 / symbolically in your count.

      13.4-6
      Professors Skelton and Baron are concerned that at the start of case 1 of RB-
      D ELETE -F IXUP, the node x:p might not be black. If the professors are correct,
      then lines 5–6 are wrong. Show that x:p must be black at the start of case 1, so that
      the professors have nothing to worry about.

      13.4-7
      Suppose that a node x is inserted into a red-black tree with RB-I NSERT and then
      is immediately deleted with RB-D ELETE. Is the resulting red-black tree the same
      as the initial red-black tree? Justify your answer.
