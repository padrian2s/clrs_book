34.5 NP-complete problems                                                         1089


cannot be complements. Thus, by the construction of G, the edge .ir ; js / belongs
to E.
   Conversely, suppose that G has a clique V 0 of size k. No edges in G connect
vertices in the same triple, and so V 0 contains exactly one vertex per triple. We can
assign 1 to each literal lir such that ir 2 V 0 without fear of assigning 1 to both a
literal and its complement, since G contains no edges between inconsistent literals.
Each clause is satisﬁed, and so  is satisﬁed. (Any variables that do not correspond
to a vertex in the clique may be set arbitrarily.)

   In the example of Figure 34.14, a satisfying assignment of  has x2 D 0 and
x3 D 1. A corresponding clique of size k D 3 consists of the vertices correspond-
ing to :x2 from the ﬁrst clause, x3 from the second clause, and x3 from the third
clause. Because the clique contains no vertices corresponding to either x1 or :x1 ,
we can set x1 to either 0 or 1 in this satisfying assignment.
   Observe that in the proof of Theorem 34.11, we reduced an arbitrary instance
of 3-CNF-SAT to an instance of CLIQUE with a particular structure. You might
think that we have shown only that CLIQUE is NP-hard in graphs in which the
vertices are restricted to occur in triples and in which there are no edges between
vertices in the same triple. Indeed, we have shown that CLIQUE is NP-hard only
in this restricted case, but this proof sufﬁces to show that CLIQUE is NP-hard in
general graphs. Why? If we had a polynomial-time algorithm that solved CLIQUE
on general graphs, it would also solve CLIQUE on restricted graphs.
   The opposite approach—reducing instances of 3-CNF-SAT with a special struc-
ture to general instances of CLIQUE—would not have sufﬁced, however. Why
not? Perhaps the instances of 3-CNF-SAT that we chose to reduce from were
“easy,” and so we would not have reduced an NP-hard problem to CLIQUE.
   Observe also that the reduction used the instance of 3-CNF-SAT, but not the
solution. We would have erred if the polynomial-time reduction had relied on
knowing whether the formula  is satisﬁable, since we do not know how to decide
whether  is satisﬁable in polynomial time.

34.5.2   The vertex-cover problem
A vertex cover of an undirected graph G D .V; E/ is a subset V 0  V such that
if .u; / 2 E, then u 2 V 0 or  2 V 0 (or both). That is, each vertex “covers” its
incident edges, and a vertex cover for G is a set of vertices that covers all the edges
in E. The size of a vertex cover is the number of vertices in it. For example, the
graph in Figure 34.15(b) has a vertex cover fw; ´g of size 2.
   The vertex-cover problem is to ﬁnd a vertex cover of minimum size in a given
graph. Restating this optimization problem as a decision problem, we wish to
