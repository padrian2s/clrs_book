C.4 The geometric and binomial distributions                                      1207


C.4-3
Show that b.kI n; p/ D b.n  kI n; q/, where q D 1  p.

C.4-4
          p of the maximum of the binomial distribution b.kI n; p/ is approx-
Show that value
imately 1= 2 npq, where q D 1  p.

C.4-5 ?
Show that the probability of no successes in n Bernoulli trials, each with probability
p D 1=n, is approximately 1=e. Show that the probability of exactly one success
is also approximately 1=e.

C.4-6 ?
Professor Rosencrantz ﬂips a fair coin n times, and so does Professor Guildenstern.
Show that the probability that they get the same number of heads is 2nn
                                                                        =4n . (Hint:
For Professor Rosencrantz, call a head a success; for Professor Guildenstern, call
a tail a success.) Use your argument to verify the identity

Consider n Bernoulli trials, where for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n, the ith trial has probabil-
ity pi of success, and let X be the random variable denoting the total number of
successes. Let p  pi for all i D 1; 2; : : : ; n. Prove that for 1  k  n,

Let X be the random variable for the total number of successes in a set A of n
Bernoulli trials, where the ith trial has a probability pi of success, and let X 0
be the random variable for the total number of successes in a second set A0 of n
Bernoulli trials, where the ith trial has a probability pi0  pi of success. Prove that
for 0  k  n,
