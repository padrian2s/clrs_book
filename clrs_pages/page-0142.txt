5.2 Indicator random variables                                                   121


By Lemma 5.1, we have that
E ŒXi  D Pr fcandidate i is hiredg ;
and we must therefore compute the probability that lines 5–6 of H IRE -A SSISTANT
are executed.
   Candidate i is hired, in line 6, exactly when candidate i is better than each of
candidates 1 through i  1. Because we have assumed that the candidates arrive in
a random order, the ﬁrst i candidates have appeared in a random order. Any one of
these ﬁrst i candidates is equally likely to be the best-qualiﬁed so far. Candidate i
has a probability of 1=i of being better qualiﬁed than candidates 1 through i  1
and thus a probability of 1=i of being hired. By Lemma 5.1, we conclude that
E ŒXi  D 1=i :                                                                 (5.3)
Now we can compute E ŒX :
            " n    #
             X
E ŒX  D E      Xi     (by equation (5.2))                                      (5.4)
                    i D1
             X
             n
        D           E ŒXi    (by linearity of expectation)
             i D1
             X
             n
        D           1=i       (by equation (5.3))
             i D1
        D ln n C O.1/ (by equation (A.7)) .                                     (5.5)
Even though we interview n people, we actually hire only approximately ln n of
them, on average. We summarize this result in the following lemma.

Lemma 5.2
Assuming that the candidates are presented in a random order, algorithm H IRE -
A SSISTANT has an average-case total hiring cost of O.ch ln n/.

Proof The bound follows immediately from our deﬁnition of the hiring cost
and equation (5.5), which shows that the expected number of hires is approxi-
mately ln n.

   The average-case hiring cost is a signiﬁcant improvement over the worst-case
hiring cost of O.ch n/.
