The .k; j / entry of Vn is !nkj , for j; k D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1. The exponents of the
entries of Vn form a multiplication table.
  For the inverse operation, which we write as a D DFT1          n .y/, we proceed by
                                1
multiplying y by the matrix Vn , the inverse of Vn .

Theorem 30.7
For j; k D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1, the .j; k/ entry of Vn1 is !nkj =n.

Proof We show that Vn1 Vn D In , the n              n identity matrix. Consider the .j; j 0 /
entry of Vn1 Vn :
                    X
                    n1
                                       0

                      kD0

                      X
                      n1
                                  0
                  D          !nk.j j / =n :
                      kD0

This summation equals 1 if j 0 D j , and it is 0 otherwise by the summation lemma
(Lemma 30.6). Note that we rely on .n  1/  j 0  j  n  1, so that j 0  j is
not divisible by n, in order for the summation lemma to apply.

   Given the inverse matrix Vn1 , we have that DFT1
                                                   n .y/ is given by


        1X
            n1
aj D       yk !nkj                                                                     (30.11)
        n
            kD0

for j D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1. By comparing equations (30.8) and (30.11), we see that
by modifying the FFT algorithm to switch the roles of a and y, replace !n by !n1 ,
and divide each element of the result by n, we compute the inverse DFT (see Ex-
ercise 30.2-4). Thus, we can compute DFT1  n in ‚.n lg n/ time as well.
   We see that, by using the FFT and the inverse FFT, we can transform a poly-
nomial of degree-bound n back and forth between its coefﬁcient representation
and a point-value representation in time ‚.n lg n/. In the context of polynomial
multiplication, we have shown the following.
