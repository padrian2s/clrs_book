26.4 Push-relabel algorithms                                                       737


  We shall begin this section by describing the intuition behind the push-relabel
method. We shall then investigate the two operations employed by the method:
“pushing” preﬂow and “relabeling” a vertex. Finally, we shall present a generic
push-relabel algorithm and analyze its correctness and running time.

Intuition
You can understand the intuition behind the push-relabel method in terms of ﬂuid
ﬂows: we consider a ﬂow network G D .V; E/ to be a system of interconnected
pipes of given capacities. Applying this analogy to the Ford-Fulkerson method,
we might say that each augmenting path in the network gives rise to an additional
stream of ﬂuid, with no branch points, ﬂowing from the source to the sink. The
Ford-Fulkerson method iteratively adds more streams of ﬂow until no more can be
added.
   The generic push-relabel algorithm has a rather different intuition. As before,
directed edges correspond to pipes. Vertices, which are pipe junctions, have two
interesting properties. First, to accommodate excess ﬂow, each vertex has an out-
ﬂow pipe leading to an arbitrarily large reservoir that can accumulate ﬂuid. Second,
each vertex, its reservoir, and all its pipe connections sit on a platform whose height
increases as the algorithm progresses.
   Vertex heights determine how ﬂow is pushed: we push ﬂow only downhill, that
is, from a higher vertex to a lower vertex. The ﬂow from a lower vertex to a higher
vertex may be positive, but operations that push ﬂow push it only downhill. We
ﬁx the height of the source at jV j and the height of the sink at 0. All other vertex
heights start at 0 and increase with time. The algorithm ﬁrst sends as much ﬂow as
possible downhill from the source toward the sink. The amount it sends is exactly
enough to ﬁll each outgoing pipe from the source to capacity; that is, it sends the
capacity of the cut .s; V  fsg/. When ﬂow ﬁrst enters an intermediate vertex, it
collects in the vertex’s reservoir. From there, we eventually push it downhill.
   We may eventually ﬁnd that the only pipes that leave a vertex u and are not
already saturated with ﬂow connect to vertices that are on the same level as u or
are uphill from u. In this case, to rid an overﬂowing vertex u of its excess ﬂow, we
must increase its height—an operation called “relabeling” vertex u. We increase
its height to one unit more than the height of the lowest of its neighbors to which
it has an unsaturated pipe. After a vertex is relabeled, therefore, it has at least one
outgoing pipe through which we can push more ﬂow.
   Eventually, all the ﬂow that can possibly get through to the sink has arrived there.
No more can arrive, because the pipes obey the capacity constraints; the amount of
ﬂow across any cut is still limited by the capacity of the cut. To make the preﬂow
a “legal” ﬂow, the algorithm then sends the excess collected in the reservoirs of
overﬂowing vertices back to the source by continuing to relabel vertices to above
