           unit-time tasks with deadlines and penalties for a single processor. The running
           time is O.n2 / using G REEDY, since each of the O.n/ independence checks made
           by that algorithm takes time O.n/ (see Exercise 16.5-2). Problem 16-4 gives a
           faster implementation.
              Figure 16.7 demonstrates an example of the problem of scheduling unit-time
           tasks with deadlines and penalties for a single processor. In this example, the
           greedy algorithm selects, in order, tasks a1 , a2 , a3 , and a4 , then rejects a5 (because
           N4 .fa1 ; a2 ; a3 ; a4 ; a5 g/ D 5) and a6 (because N4 .fa1 ; a2 ; a3 ; a4 ; a6 g/ D 5), and
           ﬁnally accepts a7 . The ﬁnal optimal schedule is
           ha2 ; a4 ; a1 ; a3 ; a7 ; a5 ; a6 i ;
           which has a total penalty incurred of w5 C w6 D 50.

           Exercises

           16.5-1
           Solve the instance of the scheduling problem given in Figure 16.7, but with each
           penalty wi replaced by 80  wi .

           16.5-2
           Show how to use property 2 of Lemma 16.12 to determine in time O.jAj/ whether
           or not a given set A of tasks is independent.



Problems

           16-1 Coin changing
           Consider the problem of making change for n cents using the fewest number of
           coins. Assume that each coin’s value is an integer.
           a. Describe a greedy algorithm to make change consisting of quarters, dimes,
              nickels, and pennies. Prove that your algorithm yields an optimal solution.
