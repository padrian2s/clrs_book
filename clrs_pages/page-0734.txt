          Figure 26.3 Converting a multiple-source, multiple-sink maximum-ﬂow problem into a problem
          with a single source and a single sink. (a) A ﬂow network with ﬁve sources S D fs1 ; s2 ; s3 ; s4 ; s5 g
          and three sinks T D ft1 ; t2 ; t3 g. (b) An equivalent single-source, single-sink ﬂow network. We add
          a supersource s and an edge with inﬁnite capacity from s to each of the multiple sources. We also
          add a supersink t and an edge with inﬁnite capacity from each of the multiple sinks to t.


          26.1-2
          Extend the ﬂow properties and deﬁnitions to the multiple-source, multiple-sink
          problem. Show that any ﬂow in a multiple-source, multiple-sink ﬂow network
          corresponds to a ﬂow of identical value in the single-source, single-sink network
          obtained by adding a supersource and a supersink, and vice versa.

          26.1-3
          Suppose that a ﬂow network G D .V; E/ violates the assumption that the network
          contains a path s ;  ; t for all vertices  2 V . Let u be a vertex for which there
          is no path s ; u ; t. Show that there must exist a maximum ﬂow f in G such
          that f .u; / D f .; u/ D 0 for all vertices  2 V .
