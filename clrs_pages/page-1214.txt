For example, suppose that we ﬂip two fair coins and that the outcomes are inde-
pendent. Then the probability of two heads is .1=2/.1=2/ D 1=4. Now suppose
that one event is that the ﬁrst coin comes up heads and the other event is that the
coins come up differently. Each of these events occurs with probability 1=2, and
the probability that both events occur is 1=4; thus, according to the deﬁnition of
independence, the events are independent—even though you might think that both
events depend on the ﬁrst coin. Finally, suppose that the coins are welded to-
gether so that they both fall heads or both fall tails and that the two possibilities are
equally likely. Then the probability that each coin comes up heads is 1=2, but the
probability that they both come up heads is 1=2 ¤ .1=2/.1=2/. Consequently, the
event that one comes up heads and the event that the other comes up heads are not
independent.

For example, suppose we ﬂip two fair coins. Let A1 be the event that the ﬁrst coin
is heads, let A2 be the event that the second coin is heads, and let A3 be the event
that the two coins are different. We have
          Pr fA1 g      D    1=2 ;
          Pr fA2 g      D    1=2 ;
          Pr fA3 g      D    1=2 ;

Since for 1  i < j  3, we have Pr fAi \ Aj g D Pr fAi g Pr fAj g D 1=4, the
events A1 , A2 , and A3 are pairwise independent. The events are not mutually inde-
pendent, however, because Pr fA1 \ A2 \ A3 g D 0 and Pr fA1 g Pr fA2 g Pr fA3 g D
