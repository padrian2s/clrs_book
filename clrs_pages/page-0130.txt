4-5 Chip testing
Professor Diogenes has n supposedly identical integrated-circuit chips that in prin-
ciple are capable of testing each other. The professor’s test jig accommodates two
chips at a time. When the jig is loaded, each chip tests the other and reports whether
it is good or bad. A good chip always reports accurately whether the other chip is
good or bad, but the professor cannot trust the answer of a bad chip. Thus, the four
possible outcomes of a test are as follows:
Chip A says     Chip B says    Conclusion
B is good       A is good      both are good, or both are bad
B is good       A is bad       at least one is bad
B is bad        A is good      at least one is bad
B is bad        A is bad       at least one is bad
a. Show that if more than n=2 chips are bad, the professor cannot necessarily de-
   termine which chips are good using any strategy based on this kind of pairwise
   test. Assume that the bad chips can conspire to fool the professor.
