           d. Show how, for any n n symmetric positive-deﬁnite, tridiagonal matrix A and
              any n-vector b, to solve the equation Ax D b in O.n/ time by performing an
              LU decomposition. Argue that any method based on forming A1 is asymptot-
              ically more expensive in the worst case.

           e. Show how, for any n n nonsingular, tridiagonal matrix A and any n-vector b, to
              solve the equation Ax D b in O.n/ time by performing an LUP decomposition.

           28-2 Splines
           A practical method for interpolating a set of points with a curve is to use cu-
           bic splines. We are given a set f.xi ; yi / W i D 0; 1; : : : ; ng of n C 1 point-value
           pairs, where x0 < x1 <    < xn . We wish to ﬁt a piecewise-cubic curve
           (spline) f .x/ to the points. That is, the curve f .x/ is made up of n cubic polyno-
           mials fi .x/ D ai C bi x C ci x 2 C di x 3 for i D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1, where if x falls in
