 Figure A.1 Approximation of nkDm f .k/ by integrals. The area of each rectangle is shown
 within the rectangle, and the total rectangle area represents the value of the summation. The in-
Rtegral
   n
        is represented
                     Pnby the shaded area under the curve. By comparing areas in (a), we get
        f .x/ dx           f .k/, and then by shifting the rectangles one unit to the right, we get
