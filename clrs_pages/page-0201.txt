             Exercises

             7.3-1
             Why do we analyze the expected running time of a randomized algorithm and not
             its worst-case running time?

             7.3-2
             When R ANDOMIZED -Q UICKSORT runs, how many calls are made to the random-
             number generator R ANDOM in the worst case? How about in the best case? Give
             your answer in terms of ‚-notation.



7.4   Analysis of quicksort

             Section 7.2 gave some intuition for the worst-case behavior of quicksort and for
             why we expect it to run quickly. In this section, we analyze the behavior of quick-
             sort more rigorously. We begin with a worst-case analysis, which applies to either
             Q UICKSORT or R ANDOMIZED -Q UICKSORT, and conclude with an analysis of the
             expected running time of R ANDOMIZED -Q UICKSORT.

             7.4.1   Worst-case analysis
             We saw in Section 7.2 that a worst-case split at every level of recursion in quicksort
             produces a ‚.n2 / running time, which, intuitively, is the worst-case running time
             of the algorithm. We now prove this assertion.
                Using the substitution method (see Section 4.3), we can show that the running
             time of quicksort is O.n2 /. Let T .n/ be the worst-case time for the procedure
             Q UICKSORT on an input of size n. We have the recurrence
             T .n/ D max .T .q/ C T .n  q  1// C ‚.n/ ;                                     (7.1)
                      0qn1

             where the parameter q ranges from 0 to n  1 because the procedure PARTITION
             produces two subproblems with total size n  1. We guess that T .n/  cn2 for
             some constant c. Substituting this guess into recurrence (7.1), we obtain
             T .n/        max .cq 2 C c.n  q  1/2 / C ‚.n/
                         0qn1

                     D c  max .q 2 C .n  q  1/2 / C ‚.n/ :
                           0qn1

               The expression q 2 C .n  q  1/2 achieves a maximum over the parameter’s
             range 0  q  n  1 at either endpoint. To verify this claim, note that the second
             derivative of the expression with respect to q is positive (see Exercise 7.4-3). This
