30   Polynomials and the FFT




     The straightforward method of adding two polynomials of degree n takes ‚.n/
     time, but the straightforward method of multiplying them takes ‚.n2 / time. In this
     chapter, we shall show how the fast Fourier transform, or FFT, can reduce the time
     to multiply polynomials to ‚.n lg n/.
        The most common use for Fourier transforms, and hence the FFT, is in signal
     processing. A signal is given in the time domain: as a function mapping time to
     amplitude. Fourier analysis allows us to express the signal as a weighted sum of
     phase-shifted sinusoids of varying frequencies. The weights and phases associated
     with the frequencies characterize the signal in the frequency domain. Among the
     many everyday applications of FFT’s are compression techniques used to encode
     digital video and audio information, including MP3 ﬁles. Several ﬁne books delve
     into the rich area of signal processing; the chapter notes reference a few of them.

     Polynomials
     A polynomial in the variable x over an algebraic ﬁeld F represents a function A.x/
     as a formal sum:
              X
              n1
     A.x/ D          aj x j :
              j D0

     We call the values a0 ; a1 ; : : : ; an1 the coefﬁcients of the polynomial. The co-
     efﬁcients are drawn from a ﬁeld F , typically the set C of complex numbers. A
     polynomial A.x/ has degree k if its highest nonzero coefﬁcient is ak ; we write
     that degree.A/ D k. Any integer strictly greater than the degree of a polynomial
     is a degree-bound of that polynomial. Therefore, the degree of a polynomial of
     degree-bound n may be any integer between 0 and n  1, inclusive.
        We can deﬁne a variety of operations on polynomials. For polynomial addi-
     tion, if A.x/ and B.x/ are polynomials of degree-bound n, their sum is a polyno-
