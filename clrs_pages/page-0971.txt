950        Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms


              Thanks to Corollary 31.26, we can use the notation a1 mod n to refer to the
           multiplicative inverse of a, modulo n, when a and n are relatively prime. If
           gcd.a; n/ D 1, then the unique solution to the equation ax  1 .mod n/ is the
           integer x returned by E XTENDED -E UCLID, since the equation
           gcd.a; n/ D 1 D ax C ny
           implies ax  1 .mod n/. Thus, we can compute a1 mod n efﬁciently using
           E XTENDED -E UCLID.

           Prove that the equation ax  ay .mod n/ implies x  y .mod n/ whenever
           gcd.a; n/ D 1. Show that the condition gcd.a; n/ D 1 is necessary by supplying a
           counterexample with gcd.a; n/ > 1.

           Will this work? Explain why or why not.

           31.4-4 ?
           Let p be prime and f .x/  f0 C f1 x C    C f t x t .mod p/ be a polyno-
           mial of degree t, with coefﬁcients fi drawn from Zp . We say that a 2 Zp

           f .x/  .x  a/g.x/ .mod p/ for some polynomial g.x/ of degree t  1. Prove
           by induction on t that if p is prime, then a polynomial f .x/ of degree t can have
           at most t distinct zeros modulo p.



31.5 The Chinese remainder theorem

           Around A . D . 100, the Chinese mathematician Sun-Tsŭ solved the problem of ﬁnd-
           ing those integers x that leave remainders 2, 3, and 2 when divided by 3, 5, and 7
           respectively. One such solution is x D 23; all solutions are of the form 23 C 105k
