Notes for Chapter 4                                                           113


   bi is a constant in the range 0 < bi < 1 for i D 1; 2; : : : ; k,
   k  1 is an integer constant, and
   f .x/ is a nonnegative function that satisﬁes the polynomial-growth condi-
    tion: there exist positive constants c1 and c2 such that for all x  1, for
    i D 1; 2; : : : ; k, and for all u such that bi x  u  x, we have c1 f .x/ 
    f .u/  c2 f .x/. (If jf 0 .x/j is upper-bounded by some polynomial in x, then
    f .x/ satisﬁes the polynomial-growth condition. For example, f .x/ D x ˛ lgˇ x
    satisﬁes this condition for any real constants ˛ and ˇ.)
Although the master method does not apply to a recurrence such as T .n/ D
T .bn=3c/ C T .b2n=3c/ C O.n/, the Akra-Bazzi method does. To solve the re-
                                                                 Pk
currence (4.30), we ﬁrst ﬁnd the unique real number p such that i D1 ai bip D 1.
(Such a p always exists.) The solution to the recurrence is then
                   Z x           
              p           f .u/

The Akra-Bazzi method can be somewhat difﬁcult to use, but it serves in solving
recurrences that model division of the problem into substantially unequally sized
subproblems. The master method is simpler to use, but it applies only when sub-
problem sizes are equal.
