29.4 Duality                                                                       885


that the solution yN is feasible for the dual problem. From inequalities (29.94) and
equations (29.95), we have that cj0  0 for all j D 1; 2; : : : ; n C m. Hence, for any
j D 1; 2; : : : ; n, equations (29.101) imply that
                 X
                 m
cj   D   cj0 C           aij yNi
                  i D1
         X
         m
               aij yNi ;
         i D1

which satisﬁes the constraints (29.84) of the dual. Finally, since cj0  0 for each
j 2 N [B, when we set yN according to equation (29.91), we have that each yNi  0,
and so the nonnegativity constraints are satisﬁed as well.

   We have shown that, given a feasible linear program, if I NITIALIZE -S IMPLEX
returns a feasible solution, and if S IMPLEX terminates without returning “un-
bounded,” then the solution returned is indeed an optimal solution. We have also
shown how to construct an optimal solution to the dual linear program.

Exercises

29.4-1
Formulate the dual of the linear program given in Exercise 29.3-5.

29.4-2
Suppose that we have a linear program that is not in standard form. We could
produce the dual by ﬁrst converting it to standard form, and then taking the dual.
It would be more convenient, however, to be able to produce the dual directly.
Explain how we can directly take the dual of an arbitrary linear program.

29.4-3
Write down the dual of the maximum-ﬂow linear program, as given in lines
(29.47)–(29.50) on page 860. Explain how to interpret this formulation as a
minimum-cut problem.

29.4-4
Write down the dual of the minimum-cost-ﬂow linear program, as given in lines
(29.51)–(29.52) on page 862. Explain how to interpret this problem in terms of
graphs and ﬂows.

29.4-5
Show that the dual of the dual of a linear program is the primal linear program.
