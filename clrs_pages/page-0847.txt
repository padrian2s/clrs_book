                  Figure 28.2 The operation of LUP-D ECOMPOSITION. (a) The input matrix A with the identity
                  permutation of the rows on the left. The ﬁrst step of the algorithm determines that the element 5
                  in the black circle in the third row is the pivot for the ﬁrst column. (b) Rows 1 and 3 are swapped
                  and the permutation is updated. The shaded column and row represent  and w T . (c) The vector 
                  is replaced by =5, and the lower right of the matrix is updated with the Schur complement. Lines
                  divide the matrix into three regions: elements of U (above), elements of L (left), and elements of the
                  Schur complement (lower right). (d)–(f) The second step. (g)–(i) The third step. No further changes
                  occur on the fourth (ﬁnal) step. (j) The LUP decomposition PA D LU .
