       Corollary C.9
       Consider a sequence of n Bernoulli trials, where in each trial success occurs with
       probability p and failure occurs with probability q D 1  p. Then for r > np,
                                      X
                                      n
       Pr fX  np  rg D                       b.kI n; p/

                                                :
                                       r

       Proof       By equation (C.37), we have        D E ŒX  D np.
