             B.2-4
             Let S be a ﬁnite set, and let R be an equivalence relation on S S. Show that if
             in addition R is antisymmetric, then the equivalence classes of S with respect to R
             are singletons.

             B.2-5
             Professor Narcissus claims that if a relation R is symmetric and transitive, then it is
             also reﬂexive. He offers the following proof. By symmetry, a R b implies b R a.
             Transitivity, therefore, implies a R a. Is the professor correct?



B.3    Functions

             Given two sets A and B, a function f is a binary relation on A and B such that
             for all a 2 A, there exists precisely one b 2 B such that .a; b/ 2 f . The set A is
             called the domain of f , and the set B is called the codomain of f . We sometimes
             write f W A ! B; and if .a; b/ 2 f , we write b D f .a/, since b is uniquely
             determined by the choice of a.
                Intuitively, the function f assigns an element of B to each element of A. No
             element of A is assigned two different elements of B, but the same element of B
             can be assigned to two different elements of A. For example, the binary relation
             f D f.a; b/ W a; b 2 N and b D a mod 2g
             is a function f W N ! f0; 1g, since for each natural number a, there is exactly one
             value b in f0; 1g such that b D a mod 2. For this example, 0 D f .0/, 1 D f .1/,
             0 D f .2/, etc. In contrast, the binary relation
             g D f.a; b/ W a; b 2 N and a C b is eveng
             is not a function, since .1; 3/ and .1; 5/ are both in g, and thus for the choice a D 1,
             there is not precisely one b such that .a; b/ 2 g.
                Given a function f W A ! B, if b D f .a/, we say that a is the argument of f
             and that b is the value of f at a. We can deﬁne a function by stating its value for
             every element of its domain. For example, we might deﬁne f .n/ D 2n for n 2 N,
             which means f D f.n; 2n/ W n 2 Ng. Two functions f and g are equal if they
             have the same domain and codomain and if, for all a in the domain, f .a/ D g.a/.
                A ﬁnite sequence of length n is a function f whose domain is the set of n
             integers f0; 1; : : : ; n  1g. We often denote a ﬁnite sequence by listing its values:
             hf .0/; f .1/; : : : ; f .n  1/i. An inﬁnite sequence is a function whose domain is
             the set N of natural numbers. For example, the Fibonacci sequence, deﬁned by
             recurrence (3.22), is the inﬁnite sequence h0; 1; 1; 2; 3; 5; 8; 13; 21; : : :i.
