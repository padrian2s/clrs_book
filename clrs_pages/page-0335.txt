      Figure 13.3 An example of how the procedure L EFT-ROTATE.T; x/ modiﬁes a binary search tree.
      Inorder tree walks of the input tree and the modiﬁed tree produce the same listing of key values.


      13.2-3
      Let a, b, and c be arbitrary nodes in subtrees ˛, ˇ, and , respectively, in the left
      tree of Figure 13.2. How do the depths of a, b, and c change when a left rotation
      is performed on node x in the ﬁgure?

      13.2-4
      Show that any arbitrary n-node binary search tree can be transformed into any other
      arbitrary n-node binary search tree using O.n/ rotations. (Hint: First show that at
      most n  1 right rotations sufﬁce to transform the tree into a right-going chain.)

      13.2-5 ?
      We say that a binary search tree T1 can be right-converted to binary search tree T2
      if it is possible to obtain T2 from T1 via a series of calls to R IGHT-ROTATE. Give
      an example of two trees T1 and T2 such that T1 cannot be right-converted to T2 .
      Then, show that if a tree T1 can be right-converted to T2 , it can be right-converted
      using O.n2 / calls to R IGHT-ROTATE.
