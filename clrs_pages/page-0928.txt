Figure 30.2 The values of !80 ; !81 ; : : : ; !87 in the complex plane, where !8 D e 2 i=8 is the prin-
cipal 8th root of unity.

!n D e 2 i=n                                                                                   (30.6)
is the principal nth root of unity;2 all other complex nth roots of unity are powers
of !n .
   The n complex nth roots of unity,
!n0 ; !n1 ; : : : ; !nn1 ;
form a group under multiplication (see Section 31.3). This group has the same
structure as the additive group .Zn ; C/ modulo n, since !nn D !n0 D 1 implies that
!nj !nk D !nj Ck D !n.j Ck/ mod n . Similarly, !n1 D !nn1 . The following lemmas
furnish some essential properties of the complex nth roots of unity.

Lemma 30.3 (Cancellation lemma)
For any integers n  0, k  0, and d > 0,
!ddnk D !nk :                                                                                   (30.7)

Proof       The lemma follows directly from equation (30.6), since
                                  dk
!ddnk D         e 2 i=d n
                              k
           D    e 2 i=n
           D !nk :


2 Many other authors deﬁne ! differently: ! D e 2 i=n . This alternative deﬁnition tends to be
                              n               n
used for signal-processing applications. The underlying mathematics is substantially the same with
either deﬁnition of !n .
