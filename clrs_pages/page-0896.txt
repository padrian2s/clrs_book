29.3 The simplex algorithm                                                        875


   The assignment in line 14 of P IVOT, y D  C ce bye , changes the objective value.
Since S IMPLEX calls P IVOT only when ce > 0, the only way for the objective
value to remain unchanged (i.e., y D ) is for bye to be 0. This value is assigned
as bye D bl =ale in line 3 of P IVOT. Since we always call P IVOT with ale ¤ 0, we
see that for bye to equal 0, and hence the objective value to be unchanged, we must
have bl D 0.
   Indeed, this situation can occur. Consider the linear program
 ´ D            x1      C x2     C x3
x4 D 8         x1       x2
x5 D                      x2      x3 :
Suppose that we choose x1 as the entering variable and x4 as the leaving variable.
After pivoting, we obtain
 ´ D 8                  C x3      x4
x1 D 8         x2                x4
x5 D            x2       x3 :
At this point, our only choice is to pivot with x3 entering and x5 leaving. Since
b5 D 0, the objective value of 8 remains unchanged after pivoting:
 ´ D 8        C x2       x4      x5
x1 D 8         x2       x4
x3 D            x2                x5 :
The objective value has not changed, but our slack form has. Fortunately, if we
pivot again, with x2 entering and x1 leaving, the objective value increases (to 16),
and the simplex algorithm can continue.
   Degeneracy can prevent the simplex algorithm from terminating, because it can
lead to a phenomenon known as cycling: the slack forms at two different itera-
tions of S IMPLEX are identical. Because of degeneracy, S IMPLEX could choose a
sequence of pivot operations that leave the objective value unchanged but repeat
a slack form within the sequence. Since S IMPLEX is a deterministic algorithm, if
it cycles, then it will cycle through the same series of slack forms forever, never
terminating.
   Cycling is the only reason that S IMPLEX might not terminate. To show this fact,
we must ﬁrst develop some additional machinery.
   At each iteration, S IMPLEX maintains A, b, c, and  in addition to the sets
N and B. Although we need to explicitly maintain A, b, c, and  in order to
implement the simplex algorithm efﬁciently, we can get by without maintaining
them. In other words, the sets of basic and nonbasic variables sufﬁce to uniquely
determine the slack form. Before proving this fact, we prove a useful algebraic
lemma.
