642   Chapter 23 Minimum Spanning Trees


      procedure MST-R EDUCE described in Problem 23-2. Kruskal’s algorithm was
      reported by Kruskal [222] in 1956. The algorithm commonly known as Prim’s
      algorithm was indeed invented by Prim [285], but it was also invented earlier by
      V. Jarnı́k in 1930.
         The reason underlying why greedy algorithms are effective at ﬁnding minimum
      spanning trees is that the set of forests of a graph forms a graphic matroid. (See
      Section 16.4.)
         When jEj D .V lg V /, Prim’s algorithm, implemented with Fibonacci heaps,
      runs in O.E/ time. For sparser graphs, using a combination of the ideas from
      Prim’s algorithm, Kruskal’s algorithm, and Boru̇vka’s algorithm, together with ad-
      vanced data structures, Fredman and Tarjan [114] give an algorithm that runs in
      O.E lg V / time. Gabow, Galil, Spencer, and Tarjan [120] improved this algo-
      rithm to run in O.E lg lg V / time. Chazelle [60] gives an algorithm that runs
      in O.E ˛  y.E; V // time, where ˛y.E; V / is the functional inverse of Ackermann’s
      function. (See the chapter notes for Chapter 21 for a brief discussion of Acker-
      mann’s function and its inverse.) Unlike previous minimum-spanning-tree algo-
      rithms, Chazelle’s algorithm does not follow the greedy method.
         A related problem is spanning-tree veriﬁcation, in which we are given a graph
      G D .V; E/ and a tree T  E, and we wish to determine whether T is a minimum
      spanning tree of G. King [203] gives a linear-time algorithm to verify a spanning
      tree, building on earlier work of Komlós [215] and Dixon, Rauch, and Tarjan [90].
         The above algorithms are all deterministic and fall into the comparison-based
      model described in Chapter 8. Karger, Klein, and Tarjan [195] give a randomized
      minimum-spanning-tree algorithm that runs in O.V C E/ expected time. This
      algorithm uses recursion in a manner similar to the linear-time selection algorithm
      in Section 9.3: a recursive call on an auxiliary problem identiﬁes a subset of the
      edges E 0 that cannot be in any minimum spanning tree. Another recursive call
      on E  E 0 then ﬁnds the minimum spanning tree. The algorithm also uses ideas
      from Boru̇vka’s algorithm and King’s algorithm for spanning-tree veriﬁcation.
         Fredman and Willard [116] showed how to ﬁnd a minimum spanning tree in
      O.V CE/ time using a deterministic algorithm that is not comparison based. Their
      algorithm assumes that the data are b-bit integers and that the computer memory
      consists of addressable b-bit words.
