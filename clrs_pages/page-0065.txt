     riety of ways. For example, we might extend the notation to the domain of real
     numbers or, alternatively, restrict it to a subset of the natural numbers. We should
     make sure, however, to understand the precise meaning of the notation so that when
     we abuse, we do not misuse it. This section deﬁnes the basic asymptotic notations
     and also introduces some common abuses.

     Asymptotic notation, functions, and running times
     We will use asymptotic notation primarily to describe the running times of algo-
     rithms, as when we wrote that insertion sort’s worst-case running time is ‚.n2 /.
     Asymptotic notation actually applies to functions, however. Recall that we charac-
     terized insertion sort’s worst-case running time as an2 CbnCc, for some constants
     a, b, and c. By writing that insertion sort’s running time is ‚.n2 /, we abstracted
     away some details of this function. Because asymptotic notation applies to func-
     tions, what we were writing as ‚.n2 / was the function an2 C bn C c, which in
     that case happened to characterize the worst-case running time of insertion sort.
        In this book, the functions to which we apply asymptotic notation will usually
     characterize the running times of algorithms. But asymptotic notation can apply to
     functions that characterize some other aspect of algorithms (the amount of space
     they use, for example), or even to functions that have nothing whatsoever to do
     with algorithms.
        Even when we use asymptotic notation to apply to the running time of an al-
     gorithm, we need to understand which running time we mean. Sometimes we are
     interested in the worst-case running time. Often, however, we wish to characterize
     the running time no matter what the input. In other words, we often wish to make
     a blanket statement that covers all inputs, not just the worst case. We shall see
     asymptotic notations that are well suited to characterizing running times no matter
     what the input.

     ‚-notation
     In Chapter 2, we found that the worst-case running time of insertion sort is
     T .n/ D ‚.n2 /. Let us deﬁne what this notation means. For a given function g.n/,
     we denote by ‚.g.n// the set of functions
     ‚.g.n// D ff .n/ W there exist positive constants c1 , c2 , and n0 such that
                        0  c1 g.n/  f .n/  c2 g.n/ for all n  n0 g :1



     1 Within set notation, a colon means “such that.”
