                Figure 16.1 The operation of R ECURSIVE -ACTIVITY-S ELECTOR on the 11 activities given ear-
                lier. Activities considered in each recursive call appear between horizontal lines. The ﬁctitious
                activity a0 ﬁnishes at time 0, and the initial call R ECURSIVE -ACTIVITY-S ELECTOR.s; f; 0; 11/, se-
                lects activity a1 . In each recursive call, the activities that have already been selected are shaded,
                and the activity shown in white is being considered. If the starting time of an activity occurs before
                the ﬁnish time of the most recently added activity (the arrow between them points left), it is re-
                jected. Otherwise (the arrow points directly up or to the right), it is selected. The last recursive call,
                R ECURSIVE -ACTIVITY-S ELECTOR.s; f; 11; 11/, returns ;. The resulting set of selected activities is
                fa1 ; a4 ; a8 ; a11 g.
