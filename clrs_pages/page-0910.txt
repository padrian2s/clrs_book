29.5 The initial basic feasible solution                                                           889


value of this auxiliary linear program is negative, then the original linear program
does not have a feasible solution.
  We write this linear program in slack form, obtaining
 ´ D                                          x0
x3 D  2            2x1         C x2         C x0
x4 D 4            x1          C 5x2        C x0 :
We are not out of the woods yet, because the basic solution, which would set
x4 D 4, is not feasible for this auxiliary linear program. We can, however, with
one call to P IVOT, convert this slack form into one in which the basic solution is
feasible. As line 8 indicates, we choose x0 to be the entering variable. In line 6, we
choose as the leaving variable x4 , which is the basic variable whose value in the
basic solution is most negative. After pivoting, we have the slack form
 ´ D 4            x1        C 5x2          x4
x0 D  4           C x1         5x2         C x4
x3 D  6            x1         4x2         C x4 :
The associated basic solution is .xN 0 ; xN 1 ; xN 2 ; xN 3 ; xN 4 / D .4; 0; 0; 6; 0/, which is feasi-
ble. We now repeatedly call P IVOT until we obtain an optimal solution to Laux . In
this case, one call to P IVOT with x2 entering and x0 leaving yields
 ´ D                x0
           4         x0         x1         x4
x2 D                      C          C
           5          5          5          5
         14         4x0        9x1         x4
x3 D           C                     C        :

This slack form is the ﬁnal solution to the auxiliary problem. Since this solution
has x0 D 0, we know that our initial problem was feasible. Furthermore, since
x0 D 0, we can just remove it from the set of constraints. We then restore the
original objective function, with appropriate substitutions made to include only
nonbasic variables. In our example, we get the objective function
                                        
                     4 x0       x1    x4

                     5     5    5      5
Setting x0 D 0 and simplifying, we get the objective function
