9   Medians and Order Statistics




    The ith order statistic of a set of n elements is the ith smallest element. For
    example, the minimum of a set of elements is the ﬁrst order statistic (i D 1),
    and the maximum is the nth order statistic (i D n). A median, informally, is
    the “halfway point” of the set. When n is odd, the median is unique, occurring at
    i D .n C 1/=2. When n is even, there are two medians, occurring at i D n=2 and
    i D n=2C1. Thus, regardless of the parity of n, medians occur at i D b.n C 1/=2c
    (the lower median) and i D d.n C 1/=2e (the upper median). For simplicity in
    this text, however, we consistently use the phrase “the median” to refer to the lower
    median.
       This chapter addresses the problem of selecting the ith order statistic from a
    set of n distinct numbers. We assume for convenience that the set contains dis-
    tinct numbers, although virtually everything that we do extends to the situation in
    which a set contains repeated values. We formally specify the selection problem
    as follows:
    Input: A set A of n (distinct) numbers and an integer i, with 1  i  n.
    Output: The element x 2 A that is larger than exactly i  1 other elements of A.
    We can solve the selection problem in O.n lg n/ time, since we can sort the num-
    bers using heapsort or merge sort and then simply index the ith element in the
    output array. This chapter presents faster algorithms.
       In Section 9.1, we examine the problem of selecting the minimum and maxi-
    mum of a set of elements. More interesting is the general selection problem, which
    we investigate in the subsequent two sections. Section 9.2 analyzes a practical
    randomized algorithm that achieves an O.n/ expected running time, assuming dis-
    tinct elements. Section 9.3 contains an algorithm of more theoretical interest that
    achieves the O.n/ running time in the worst case.
