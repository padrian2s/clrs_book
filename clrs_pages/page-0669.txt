                   shaded edges form a shortest-paths tree rooted at the source s. (c) Another shortest-paths tree with
                   the same root.

                   Shortest paths are not necessarily unique, and neither are shortest-paths trees. For
                   example, Figure 24.2 shows a weighted, directed graph and two shortest-paths trees
                   with the same root.

                   Relaxation
                   The algorithms in this chapter use the technique of relaxation. For each vertex
                    2 V , we maintain an attribute :d, which is an upper bound on the weight of
                   a shortest path from source s to . We call :d a shortest-path estimate. We
                   initialize the shortest-path estimates and predecessors by the following ‚.V /-time
                   procedure:

                   I NITIALIZE -S INGLE -S OURCE .G; s/
                   1 for each vertex  2 G:V
                   2       :d D 1
                   3       : D NIL
                   4 s:d D 0
                   After initialization, we have : D NIL for all  2 V , s:d D 0, and :d D 1 for
                    2 V  fsg.
                     The process of relaxing an edge .u; / consists of testing whether we can im-
                   prove the shortest path to  found so far by going through u and, if so, updat-
                   ing :d and :. A relaxation step1 may decrease the value of the shortest-path


                   1 It may seem strange that the term “relaxation” is used for an operation that tightens an upper bound.

                   The use of the term is historical. The outcome of a relaxation step can be viewed as a relaxation
                   of the constraint : d  u: d C w.u; /, which, by the triangle inequality (Lemma 24.10), must be
                   satisﬁed if u: d D ı.s; u/ and : d D ı.s; /. That is, if : d  u: d C w.u; /, there is no “pressure”
                   to satisfy this constraint, so the constraint is “relaxed.”
