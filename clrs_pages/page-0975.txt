31.6 Powers of an element

           Just as we often consider the multiples of a given element a, modulo n, we consider
           the sequence of powers of a, modulo n, where a 2 Zn :
           a0 ; a1 ; a2 ; a3 ; : : : ;                                                    (31.33)
                                                                                   0
           modulo n. Indexing from 0, the 0th value in this sequence is a mod n D 1, and
           the ith value is ai mod n. For example, the powers of 3 modulo 7 are
                   i          0     1    2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   11   
             i
            3 mod 7           1     3    2   6   4   5   1   3   2   6   4    5    
           whereas the powers of 2 modulo 7 are
                   i          0     1    2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   11   
             i
            2 mod 7           1     2    4   1   2   4   1   2   4   1   2    4    
                 In this section, let hai denote the subgroup of Zn generated by a by repeated
           multiplication, and let ordn .a/ (the “order of a, modulo n”) denote the order of a
           in Zn . For example, h2i D f1; 2; 4g in Z7 , and ord7 .2/ D 3. Using the deﬁnition of
           the Euler phi function .n/ as the size of Zn (see Section 31.3), we now translate
           Corollary 31.19 into the notation of Zn to obtain Euler’s theorem and specialize it
           to Zp , where p is prime, to obtain Fermat’s theorem.

           Theorem 31.30 (Euler’s theorem)
           For any integer n > 1,
           a.n/  1 .mod n/ for all a 2 Zn :
