10.1 Stacks and queues                                                           235


When Q:head D Q:tail C 1, the queue is full, and if we attempt to enqueue an
element, then the queue overﬂows.
   In our procedures E NQUEUE and D EQUEUE, we have omitted the error checking
for underﬂow and overﬂow. (Exercise 10.1-4 asks you to supply code that checks
for these two error conditions.) The pseudocode assumes that n D Q:length.

E NQUEUE .Q; x/
1 QŒQ:tail D x
2 if Q:tail == Q:length
3      Q:tail D 1
4 else Q:tail D Q:tail C 1

D EQUEUE .Q/
1 x D QŒQ:head
2 if Q:head == Q:length
3      Q:head D 1
4 else Q:head D Q:head C 1
5 return x

Figure 10.2 shows the effects of the E NQUEUE and D EQUEUE operations. Each
operation takes O.1/ time.

Exercises

10.1-1
Using Figure 10.1 as a model, illustrate the result of each operation in the sequence
P USH .S; 4/, P USH .S; 1/, P USH .S; 3/, P OP.S/, P USH .S; 8/, and P OP.S/ on an
initially empty stack S stored in array SŒ1 : : 6.

10.1-2
Explain how to implement two stacks in one array AŒ1 : : n in such a way that
neither stack overﬂows unless the total number of elements in both stacks together
is n. The P USH and P OP operations should run in O.1/ time.

10.1-3
Using Figure 10.2 as a model, illustrate the result of each operation in the
sequence E NQUEUE .Q; 4/, E NQUEUE .Q; 1/, E NQUEUE .Q; 3/, D EQUEUE .Q/,
E NQUEUE .Q; 8/, and D EQUEUE .Q/ on an initially empty queue Q stored in
array QŒ1 : : 6.

10.1-4
Rewrite E NQUEUE and D EQUEUE to detect underﬂow and overﬂow of a queue.
