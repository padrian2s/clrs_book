                          The running time of Kruskal’s algorithm for a graph G D .V; E/ depends
                       on how we implement the disjoint-set data structure. We assume that we use
                       the disjoint-set-forest implementation of Section 21.3 with the union-by-rank and
                       path-compression heuristics, since it is the asymptotically fastest implementation
                       known. Initializing the set A in line 1 takes O.1/ time, and the time to sort the
                       edges in line 4 is O.E lg E/. (We will account for the cost of the jV j M AKE -S ET
                       operations in the for loop of lines 2–3 in a moment.) The for loop of lines 5–8
                       performs O.E/ F IND -S ET and U NION operations on the disjoint-set forest. Along
                       with the jV j M AKE -S ET operations, these take a total of O..V C E/ ˛.V // time,
                       where ˛ is the very slowly growing function deﬁned in Section 21.4. Because we
                       assume that G is connected, we have jEj  jV j  1, and so the disjoint-set opera-
                       tions take O.E ˛.V // time. Moreover, since ˛.jV j/ D O.lg V / D O.lg E/, the to-
                       tal running time of Kruskal’s algorithm is O.E lg E/. Observing that jEj < jV j2 ,
                       we have lg jEj D O.lg V /, and so we can restate the running time of Kruskal’s
                       algorithm as O.E lg V /.
