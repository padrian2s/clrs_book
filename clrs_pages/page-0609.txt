588   Part VI Graph Algorithms


         When we characterize the running time of a graph algorithm on a given graph
      G D .V; E/, we usually measure the size of the input in terms of the number of
      vertices jV j and the number of edges jEj of the graph. That is, we describe the
      size of the input with two parameters, not just one. We adopt a common notational
      convention for these parameters. Inside asymptotic notation (such as O-notation
      or ‚-notation), and only inside such notation, the symbol V denotes jV j and
      the symbol E denotes jEj. For example, we might say, “the algorithm runs in
      time O.VE/,” meaning that the algorithm runs in time O.jV j jEj/. This conven-
      tion makes the running-time formulas easier to read, without risk of ambiguity.
         Another convention we adopt appears in pseudocode. We denote the vertex set
      of a graph G by G:V and its edge set by G:E. That is, the pseudocode views vertex
      and edge sets as attributes of a graph.
