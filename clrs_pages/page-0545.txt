      Lemma 19.2
      For all integers k  0,
                        X
                        k
      FkC2 D 1 C               Fi :
                        i D0


      Proof       The proof is by induction on k. When k D 0,
           X
           0
      1C          Fi    D 1 C F0
           i D0
                        D 1C0
                        D F2 :
                                                                           Pk1
        We now assume the inductive hypothesis that FkC1 D 1 C                i D0 Fi , and we
      have
      FkC2 D Fk C FkC1
                                                         !
                                             X
                                             k1
              D Fk C 1 C                            Fi
                                             i D0

                           X
                           k
              D 1C                    Fi :
                               i D0



      Lemma 19.3
      For all integers k  0, the .k C 2/nd Fibonacci number satisﬁes FkC2   k .

      Proof The proof is by induction on k. The base cases are for k D 0 and k D 1.
      When k D 0 we have F2 D 1 D  0 , and when k D 1 we have F3 D 2 >
      1:619 >  1 . The inductive step is for k  2, and we assume that Fi C2 >  i for
      i D 0; 1; : : : ; k1. Recall that  is the positive root of equation (3.23), x 2 D x C1.
      Thus, we have
      FkC2 D           FkC1 C Fk
                       k1 C  k2 (by the inductive hypothesis)
           D            k2 . C 1/
           D            k2   2   (by equation (3.23))
                         k
           D            :

        The following lemma and its corollary complete the analysis.
