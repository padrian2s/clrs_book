1140   Chapter 35 Approximation Algorithms


          As mentioned in the chapter notes for Chapter 34, recent results in probabilisti-
       cally checkable proofs have led to lower bounds on the approximability of many
       problems, including several in this chapter. In addition to the references there,
       the chapter by Arora and Lund [23] contains a good description of the relation-
       ship between probabilistically checkable proofs and the hardness of approximating
       various problems.
