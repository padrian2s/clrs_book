            Figure 15.2 The 8 possible ways of cutting up a rod of length 4. Above each piece is the
            value of that piece, according to the sample price chart of Figure 15.1. The optimal strategy is
            part (c)—cutting the rod into two pieces of length 2—which has total value 10.


            for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n  1.1 We denote a decomposition into pieces using ordinary
            additive notation, so that 7 D 2 C 2 C 3 indicates that a rod of length 7 is cut into
            three pieces—two of length 2 and one of length 3. If an optimal solution cuts the
            rod into k pieces, for some 1  k  n, then an optimal decomposition
            n D i1 C i2 C    C ik
            of the rod into pieces of lengths i1 , i2 , . . . , ik provides maximum corresponding
            revenue

              For our sample problem, we can determine the optimal revenue ﬁgures ri , for
            i D 1; 2; : : : ; 10, by inspection, with the corresponding optimal decompositions


            1 If we required the pieces to be cut in order of nondecreasing size, there would be fewer ways

            to consider. For n D 4, we would consider only 5 such ways: parts (a), (b), (c), (e), and (h)
            in p
               Figure 15.2. The number of ways is called the partition function; it is approximately equal to
                         p
            e  2n=3 =4n 3. This quantity is less than 2n1 , but still much greater than any polynomial in n.
            We shall not pursue this line of inquiry further, however.
