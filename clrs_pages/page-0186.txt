Figure 6.5 The operation of H EAP -I NCREASE -K EY. (a) The max-heap of Figure 6.4(a) with a
node whose index is i heavily shaded. (b) This node has its key increased to 15. (c) After one
iteration of the while loop of lines 4–6, the node and its parent have exchanged keys, and the index i
moves up to the parent. (d) The max-heap after one more iteration of the while loop. At this point,
AŒPARENT.i/  AŒi. The max-heap property now holds and the procedure terminates.


6.5-2
Illustrate the operation of M AX -H EAP -I NSERT .A; 10/ on the heap A D h15; 13; 9;
5; 12; 8; 7; 4; 0; 6; 2; 1i.

6.5-3
Write pseudocode for the procedures H EAP -M INIMUM, H EAP -E XTRACT-M IN,
H EAP -D ECREASE -K EY, and M IN -H EAP -I NSERT that implement a min-priority
queue with a min-heap.

6.5-4
Why do we bother setting the key of the inserted node to 1 in line 2 of M AX -
H EAP -I NSERT when the next thing we do is increase its key to the desired value?
