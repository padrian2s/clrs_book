      pi 1 pi , fully parenthesize the product A1 A2    An in a way that minimizes the
      number of scalar multiplications.
         Note that in the matrix-chain multiplication problem, we are not actually multi-
      plying matrices. Our goal is only to determine an order for multiplying matrices
      that has the lowest cost. Typically, the time invested in determining this optimal
      order is more than paid for by the time saved later on when actually performing the
      matrix multiplications (such as performing only 7500 scalar multiplications instead
      of 75,000).

      Counting the number of parenthesizations
      Before solving the matrix-chain multiplication problem by dynamic programming,
      let us convince ourselves that exhaustively checking all possible parenthesizations
      does not yield an efﬁcient algorithm. Denote the number of alternative parenthe-
      sizations of a sequence of n matrices by P .n/. When n D 1, we have just one
      matrix and therefore only one way to fully parenthesize the matrix product. When
      n  2, a fully parenthesized matrix product is the product of two fully parenthe-
      sized matrix subproducts, and the split between the two subproducts may occur
      between the kth and .k C 1/st matrices for any k D 1; 2; : : : ; n  1. Thus, we

                1
      obtain the recurrence
                                       if n D 1 ;
      P .n/ D    X
                 n1
                                                                                     (15.6)
                       P .k/P .n  k/ if n  2 :
                 kD1

      Problem 12-4 asked you to show that the solution to a similar recurrence is the
      sequence of Catalan numbers, which grows as .4n =n3=2 /. A simpler exercise
      (see Exercise 15.2-3) is to show that the solution to the recurrence (15.6) is .2n /.
      The number of solutions is thus exponential in n, and the brute-force method of
      exhaustive search makes for a poor strategy when determining how to optimally
      parenthesize a matrix chain.

      Applying dynamic programming
      We shall use the dynamic-programming method to determine how to optimally
      parenthesize a matrix chain. In so doing, we shall follow the four-step sequence
      that we stated at the beginning of this chapter:
      1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution.
      2. Recursively deﬁne the value of an optimal solution.
      3. Compute the value of an optimal solution.
