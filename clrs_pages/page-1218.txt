that the probability distribution is uniform, so that each elementary event s 2 S is
equally likely: Pr fsg D 1=36. Deﬁne the random variable X to be the maximum of
the two values showing on the dice. We have Pr fX D 3g D 5=36, since X assigns
a value of 3 to 5 of the 36 possible elementary events, namely, .1; 3/, .2; 3/, .3; 3/,
.3; 2/, and .3; 1/.
   We often deﬁne several random variables on the same sample space. If X and Y
are random variables, the function
f .x; y/ D Pr fX D x and Y D yg
is the joint probability density function of X and Y . For a ﬁxed value y,
                X
Pr fY D yg D        Pr fX D x and Y D yg ;
                 x

and similarly, for a ﬁxed value x,
                X
Pr fX D xg D         Pr fX D x and Y D yg :
                 y

Using the deﬁnition (C.14) of conditional probability, we have
                          Pr fX D x and Y D yg
Pr fX D x j Y D yg D                           :
                               Pr fY D yg
We deﬁne two random variables X and Y to be independent if for all x and y, the
events X D x and Y D y are independent or, equivalently, if for all x and y, we
have Pr fX D x and Y D yg D Pr fX D xg Pr fY D yg.
  Given a set of random variables deﬁned over the same sample space, we can
deﬁne new random variables as sums, products, or other functions of the original
variables.

Expected value of a random variable
The simplest and most useful summary of the distribution of a random variable is
the “average” of the values it takes on. The expected value (or, synonymously,
expectation or mean) of a discrete random variable X is
         X
E ŒX  D    x  Pr fX D xg ;                                             (C.20)
           x

which is well deﬁned if the sum is ﬁnite or converges absolutely. Sometimes the
expectation of X is denoted by X or, when the random variable is apparent from
context, simply by .
   Consider a game in which you ﬂip two fair coins. You earn $3 for each head but
lose $2 for each tail. The expected value of the random variable X representing
