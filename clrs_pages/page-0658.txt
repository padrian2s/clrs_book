23.2-1
Kruskal’s algorithm can return different spanning trees for the same input graph G,
depending on how it breaks ties when the edges are sorted into order. Show that
for each minimum spanning tree T of G, there is a way to sort the edges of G in
Kruskal’s algorithm so that the algorithm returns T .

23.2-2
Suppose that we represent the graph G D .V; E/ as an adjacency matrix. Give a
simple implementation of Prim’s algorithm for this case that runs in O.V 2 / time.

23.2-3
For a sparse graph G D .V; E/, where jEj D ‚.V /, is the implementation of
Prim’s algorithm with a Fibonacci heap asymptotically faster than the binary-heap
implementation? What about for a dense graph, where jEj D ‚.V 2 /? How
must the sizes jEj and jV j be related for the Fibonacci-heap implementation to
be asymptotically faster than the binary-heap implementation?

23.2-4
Suppose that all edge weights in a graph are integers in the range from 1 to jV j.
How fast can you make Kruskal’s algorithm run? What if the edge weights are
integers in the range from 1 to W for some constant W ?

23.2-5
Suppose that all edge weights in a graph are integers in the range from 1 to jV j.
How fast can you make Prim’s algorithm run? What if the edge weights are integers
in the range from 1 to W for some constant W ?

23.2-6 ?
Suppose that the edge weights in a graph are uniformly distributed over the half-
open interval Œ0; 1/. Which algorithm, Kruskal’s or Prim’s, can you make run
faster?

23.2-7 ?
Suppose that a graph G has a minimum spanning tree already computed. How
quickly can we update the minimum spanning tree if we add a new vertex and
incident edges to G?

23.2-8
Professor Borden proposes a new divide-and-conquer algorithm for computing
minimum spanning trees, which goes as follows. Given a graph G D .V; E/,
partition the set V of vertices into two sets V1 and V2 such that jV1 j and jV2 j differ
