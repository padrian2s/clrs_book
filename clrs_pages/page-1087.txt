1066   Chapter 34 NP-Completeness


       34.2-4
       Prove that the class NP of languages is closed under union, intersection, concate-
       nation, and Kleene star. Discuss the closure of NP under complement.

       34.2-5
       Show that any language in NP can be decided by an algorithm running in
                k
       time 2O.n / for some constant k.

       34.2-6
       A hamiltonian path in a graph is a simple path that visits every vertex exactly
       once. Show that the language HAM-PATH D fhG; u; i W there is a hamiltonian
       path from u to  in graph Gg belongs to NP.

       34.2-7
       Show that the hamiltonian-path problem from Exercise 34.2-6 can be solved in
       polynomial time on directed acyclic graphs. Give an efﬁcient algorithm for the
       problem.

       34.2-8
       Let  be a boolean formula constructed from the boolean input variables x1 ; x2 ;
       : : : ; xk , negations (:), ANDs (^), ORs (_), and parentheses. The formula  is a
       tautology if it evaluates to 1 for every assignment of 1 and 0 to the input variables.
       Deﬁne TAUTOLOGY as the language of boolean formulas that are tautologies.
       Show that TAUTOLOGY 2 co-NP.

       34.2-9
       Prove that P  co-NP.

       34.2-10
       Prove that if NP ¤ co-NP, then P ¤ NP.

       34.2-11
       Let G be a connected, undirected graph with at least 3 vertices, and let G 3 be the
       graph obtained by connecting all pairs of vertices that are connected by a path in G
       of length at most 3. Prove that G 3 is hamiltonian. (Hint: Construct a spanning tree
       for G, and use an inductive argument.)
