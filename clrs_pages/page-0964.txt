31.3 Modular arithmetic                                                               943


we have that 71  13 .mod 15/, since 7  13 D 91  1 .mod 15/, so that
4=7  4  13  7 .mod 15/.
   The size of Zn is denoted .n/. This function, known as Euler’s phi function,
satisﬁes the equation
             Y            
                         1
.n/ D n             1      ;                                            (31.20)
                         p
      p W p is prime and p j n

so that p runs over all the primes dividing n (including n itself, if n is prime).
We shall not prove this formula here. Intuitively, we begin with a list of the n
remainders f0; 1; : : : ; n  1g and then, for each prime p that divides n, cross out
every multiple of p in the list. For example, since the prime divisors of 45 are 3
and 5,
                                  
                         1         1

If n is composite, then .n/ < n  1, although it can be shown that
                  n
.n/ >                                                                           (31.22)
          e ln ln n C ln ln3 n
for n  3, where D 0:5772156649 : : : is Euler’s constant. A somewhat simpler
(but looser) lower bound for n > 5 is
             n
.n/ >             :                                                  (31.23)
         6 ln ln n
The lower bound (31.22) is essentially the best possible, since
          .n/
lim inf            D e  :                                           (31.24)
 n!1 n= ln ln n



Subgroups
If .S; ˚/ is a group, S 0  S, and .S 0 ; ˚/ is also a group, then .S 0 ; ˚/ is a subgroup
of .S; ˚/. For example, the even integers form a subgroup of the integers under the
operation of addition. The following theorem provides a useful tool for recognizing
subgroups.
