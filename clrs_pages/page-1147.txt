          The A PPROX -M IN -W EIGHT-VC procedure works as follows. Line 1 initial-
       izes the vertex cover to be empty. Line 2 formulates the linear program in
       lines (35.17)–(35.20) and then solves this linear program. An optimal solution
       gives each vertex  an associated value Nx./, where 0  Nx./  1. We use this
       value to guide the choice of which vertices to add to the vertex cover C in lines 3–5.
       If Nx./  1=2, we add  to C ; otherwise we do not. In effect, we are “rounding”
       each fractional variable in the solution to the linear program to 0 or 1 in order to
       obtain a solution to the 0-1 integer program in lines (35.14)–(35.16). Finally, line 6
       returns the vertex cover C .

       Theorem 35.7
       Algorithm A PPROX -M IN -W EIGHT-VC is a polynomial-time 2-approximation al-
       gorithm for the minimum-weight vertex-cover problem.

       Proof Because there is a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the linear program
       in line 2, and because the for loop of lines 3–5 runs in polynomial time, A PPROX -
       M IN -W EIGHT-VC is a polynomial-time algorithm.
          Now we show that A PPROX -M IN -W EIGHT-VC is a 2-approximation algo-
       rithm. Let C  be an optimal solution to the minimum-weight vertex-cover prob-
       lem, and let ´ be the value of an optimal solution to the linear program in
       lines (35.17)–(35.20). Since an optimal vertex cover is a feasible solution to the
       linear program, ´ must be a lower bound on w.C  /, that is,
       ´  w.C  / :                                                                (35.21)
       Next, we claim that by rounding the fractional values of the variables Nx./, we
       produce a set C that is a vertex cover and satisﬁes w.C /  2´ . To see that C is
       a vertex cover, consider any edge .u; / 2 E. By constraint (35.18), we know that
       x.u/ C x./  1, which implies that at least one of Nx.u/ and Nx./ is at least 1=2.
       Therefore, at least one of u and  is included in the vertex cover, and so every edge
       is covered.
          Now, we consider the weight of the cover. We have
