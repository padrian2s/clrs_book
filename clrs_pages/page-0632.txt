Figure 22.6 A directed graph for use in Exercises 22.3-2 and 22.5-2.


22.3-3
Show the parenthesis structure of the depth-ﬁrst search of Figure 22.4.

22.3-4
Show that using a single bit to store each vertex color sufﬁces by arguing that
the DFS procedure would produce the same result if line 3 of DFS-V ISIT was
removed.

22.3-5
Show that edge .u; / is
a. a tree edge or forward edge if and only if u:d < :d < :f < u:f ,
b. a back edge if and only if :d  u:d < u:f  :f , and
c. a cross edge if and only if :d < :f < u:d < u:f .

22.3-6
Show that in an undirected graph, classifying an edge .u; / as a tree edge or a back
edge according to whether .u; / or .; u/ is encountered ﬁrst during the depth-ﬁrst
search is equivalent to classifying it according to the ordering of the four types in
the classiﬁcation scheme.

22.3-7
Rewrite the procedure DFS, using a stack to eliminate recursion.

22.3-8
Give a counterexample to the conjecture that if a directed graph G contains a path
from u to , and if u:d < :d in a depth-ﬁrst search of G, then  is a descendant
of u in the depth-ﬁrst forest produced.
