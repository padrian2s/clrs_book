           31.2 Greatest common divisor                                                     933


           31.1-8
           For any integer k > 0, an integer n is a kth power if there exists an integer a such
           that ak D n. Furthermore, n > 1 is a nontrivial power if it is a kth power for
           some integer k > 1. Show how to determine whether a given ˇ-bit integer n is a
           nontrivial power in time polynomial in ˇ.

           31.1-9
           Prove equations (31.6)–(31.10).

           31.1-10
           Show that the gcd operator is associative. That is, prove that for all integers a, b,
           and c,
           gcd.a; gcd.b; c// D gcd.gcd.a; b/; c/ :

           31.1-11 ?
           Prove Theorem 31.8.

           31.1-12
           Give efﬁcient algorithms for the operations of dividing a ˇ-bit integer by a shorter
           integer and of taking the remainder of a ˇ-bit integer when divided by a shorter
           integer. Your algorithms should run in time ‚.ˇ 2 /.

           31.1-13
           Give an efﬁcient algorithm to convert a given ˇ-bit (binary) integer to a decimal
           representation. Argue that if multiplication or division of integers whose length
           is at most ˇ takes time M.ˇ/, then we can convert binary to decimal in time
           ‚.M.ˇ/ lg ˇ/. (Hint: Use a divide-and-conquer approach, obtaining the top and
           bottom halves of the result with separate recursions.)



31.2 Greatest common divisor

           In this section, we describe Euclid’s algorithm for efﬁciently computing the great-
           est common divisor of two integers. When we analyze the running time, we shall
           see a surprising connection with the Fibonacci numbers, which yield a worst-case
           input for Euclid’s algorithm.
              We restrict ourselves in this section to nonnegative integers. This restriction is
           justiﬁed by equation (31.8), which states that gcd.a; b/ D gcd.jaj ; jbj/.
