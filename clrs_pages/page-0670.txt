Figure 24.3 shows two examples of relaxing an edge, one in which a shortest-path
estimate decreases and one in which no estimate changes.
   Each algorithm in this chapter calls I NITIALIZE -S INGLE -S OURCE and then re-
peatedly relaxes edges. Moreover, relaxation is the only means by which shortest-
path estimates and predecessors change. The algorithms in this chapter differ in
how many times they relax each edge and the order in which they relax edges. Dijk-
stra’s algorithm and the shortest-paths algorithm for directed acyclic graphs relax
each edge exactly once. The Bellman-Ford algorithm relaxes each edge jV j  1
times.

Properties of shortest paths and relaxation
To prove the algorithms in this chapter correct, we shall appeal to several prop-
erties of shortest paths and relaxation. We state these properties here, and Sec-
tion 24.5 proves them formally. For your reference, each property stated here in-
cludes the appropriate lemma or corollary number from Section 24.5. The latter
ﬁve of these properties, which refer to shortest-path estimates or the predecessor
subgraph, implicitly assume that the graph is initialized with a call to I NITIALIZE -
S INGLE -S OURCE.G; s/ and that the only way that shortest-path estimates and the
predecessor subgraph change are by some sequence of relaxation steps.
