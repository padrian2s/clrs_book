Chapter notes

           Ahuja, Magnanti, and Orlin [7], Even [103], Lawler [224], Papadimitriou and Stei-
           glitz [271], and Tarjan [330] are good references for network ﬂow and related algo-
           rithms. Goldberg, Tardos, and Tarjan [139] also provide a nice survey of algorithms
           for network-ﬂow problems, and Schrijver [304] has written an interesting review
           of historical developments in the ﬁeld of network ﬂows.
              The Ford-Fulkerson method is due to Ford and Fulkerson [109], who originated
           the formal study of many of the problems in the area of network ﬂow, including
           the maximum-ﬂow and bipartite-matching problems. Many early implementations
           of the Ford-Fulkerson method found augmenting paths using breadth-ﬁrst search;
           Edmonds and Karp [102], and independently Dinic [89], proved that this strategy
           yields a polynomial-time algorithm. A related idea, that of using “blocking ﬂows,”
           was also ﬁrst developed by Dinic [89]. Karzanov [202] ﬁrst developed the idea of
           preﬂows. The push-relabel method is due to Goldberg [136] and Goldberg and Tar-
           jan [140]. Goldberg and Tarjan gave an O.V 3 /-time algorithm that uses a queue to
           maintain the set of overﬂowing vertices, as well as an algorithm that uses dynamic
           trees to achieve a running time of O.VE lg.V 2 =E C 2//. Several other researchers
           have developed push-relabel maximum-ﬂow algorithms. Ahuja and Orlin [9] and
           Ahuja, Orlin, and Tarjan [10] gave algorithms that used scaling. Cheriyan and
           Maheshwari [62] proposed pushing ﬂow from the overﬂowing vertex of maximum
           height. Cheriyan and Hagerup [61] suggested randomly permuting the neighbor
           lists, and several researchers [14, 204, 276] developed clever derandomizations of
           this idea, leading to a sequence of faster algorithms. The algorithm of King, Rao,
           and Tarjan [204] is the fastest such algorithm and runs in O.VE logE=.V lg V / V /
           time.
              The asymptotically fastest algorithm to date for the maximum-ﬂow problem, by
           Goldberg and Rao [138], runs in time O.min.V 2=3 ; E 1=2 /E lg.V 2 =E C 2/ lg C /,
           where C D max.u;/2E c.u; /. This algorithm does not use the push-relabel
           method but instead is based on ﬁnding blocking ﬂows. All previous maximum-
           ﬂow algorithms, including the ones in this chapter, use some notion of distance
           (the push-relabel algorithms use the analogous notion of height), with a length of 1
