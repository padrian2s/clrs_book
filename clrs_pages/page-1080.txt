34.1 Polynomial time                                                                      1059


algorithm A accepts x in time O.nk /. A language L is decided in polynomial
time by an algorithm A if there exists a constant k such that for any length-n string
x 2 f0; 1g , the algorithm correctly decides whether x 2 L in time O.nk /. Thus,
to accept a language, an algorithm need only produce an answer when provided a
string in L, but to decide a language, it must correctly accept or reject every string
in f0; 1g .
   As an example, the language PATH can be accepted in polynomial time. One
polynomial-time accepting algorithm veriﬁes that G encodes an undirected graph,
veriﬁes that u and  are vertices in G, uses breadth-ﬁrst search to compute a short-
est path from u to  in G, and then compares the number of edges on the shortest
path obtained with k. If G encodes an undirected graph and the path found from u
to  has at most k edges, the algorithm outputs 1 and halts. Otherwise, the algo-
rithm runs forever. This algorithm does not decide PATH, however, since it does
not explicitly output 0 for instances in which a shortest path has more than k edges.
A decision algorithm for PATH must explicitly reject binary strings that do not be-
long to PATH. For a decision problem such as PATH, such a decision algorithm is
easy to design: instead of running forever when there is not a path from u to  with
at most k edges, it outputs 0 and halts. (It must also output 0 and halt if the input
encoding is faulty.) For other problems, such as Turing’s Halting Problem, there
exists an accepting algorithm, but no decision algorithm exists.
   We can informally deﬁne a complexity class as a set of languages, membership
in which is determined by a complexity measure, such as running time, of an
algorithm that determines whether a given string x belongs to language L. The
actual deﬁnition of a complexity class is somewhat more technical.6
   Using this language-theoretic framework, we can provide an alternative deﬁni-
tion of the complexity class P:
P D fL  f0; 1g W there exists an algorithm A that decides L
                   in polynomial timeg :
In fact, P is also the class of languages that can be accepted in polynomial time.

Theorem 34.2
P D fL W L is accepted by a polynomial-time algorithmg :

Proof Because the class of languages decided by polynomial-time algorithms is
a subset of the class of languages accepted by polynomial-time algorithms, we
need only show that if L is accepted by a polynomial-time algorithm, it is de-
cided by a polynomial-time algorithm. Let L be the language accepted by some
