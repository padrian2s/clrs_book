Figure 34.9 The sequence of conﬁgurations produced by an algorithm A running on an input x and
certiﬁcate y. Each conﬁguration represents the state of the computer for one step of the computation
and, besides A, x, and y, includes the program counter (PC), auxiliary machine state, and working
storage. Except for the certiﬁcate y, the initial conﬁguration c0 is constant. A boolean combinational
circuit M maps each conﬁguration to the next conﬁguration. The output is a distinguished bit in the
working storage.
