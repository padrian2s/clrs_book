       C.1-5
       Prove the identity

        n      n n1
            D                                                                          (C.8)
        k      k k1
       for 0 < k  n.

       C.1-6
       Prove the identity
          !                 !

            D
        k      nk        k
       for 0  k < n.

       C.1-7
       To choose k objects from n, you can make one of the objects distinguished and
       consider whether the distinguished object is chosen. Use this approach to prove
       that
           !         !            !
         n      n1         n1
             D          C           :
         k        k         k1

       C.1-8
       Using the result of Exercise C.1-7, make a table for n D 0; 1; : : : ; 6 and 0  k  n
       of the binomial coefﬁcients kn with 00 at the top, 10 and 11 on the next line, and
       so forth. Such a table of binomial coefﬁcients is called Pascal’s triangle.

       C.1-9
       Prove that
                     !
       X n
                  nC1
            iD         :
       i D1

       C.1-10
                                                                             n
       Show that for any integers n  0 and 0  k  n, the expression        k
                                                                                 achieves its
       maximum value when k D bn=2c or k D dn=2e.

       C.1-11 ?
       Argue that for any integers n  0, j  0, k  0, and j C k  n,
              !         !        !
