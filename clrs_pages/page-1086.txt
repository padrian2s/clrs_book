Figure 34.3 Four possibilities for relationships among complexity classes. In each diagram, one
region enclosing another indicates a proper-subset relation. (a) P D NP D co-NP. Most researchers
regard this possibility as the most unlikely. (b) If NP is closed under complement, then NP D co-NP,
but it need not be the case that P D NP. (c) P D NP\co-NP, but NP is not closed under complement.
(d) NP ¤ co-NP and P ¤ NP \ co-NP. Most researchers regard this possibility as the most likely.


   Thus, our understanding of the precise relationship between P and NP is woe-
fully incomplete. Nevertheless, even though we might not be able to prove that a
particular problem is intractable, if we can prove that it is NP-complete, then we
have gained valuable information about it.
