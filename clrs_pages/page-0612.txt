22.1 Representations of graphs                                                    591


an undirected graph, the sum of the lengths of all the adjacency lists is 2 jEj, since
if .u; / is an undirected edge, then u appears in ’s adjacency list and vice versa.
For both directed and undirected graphs, the adjacency-list representation has the
desirable property that the amount of memory it requires is ‚.V C E/.
   We can readily adapt adjacency lists to represent weighted graphs, that is, graphs
for which each edge has an associated weight, typically given by a weight function
w W E ! R. For example, let G D .V; E/ be a weighted graph with weight
function w. We simply store the weight w.u; / of the edge .u; / 2 E with
vertex  in u’s adjacency list. The adjacency-list representation is quite robust in
that we can modify it to support many other graph variants.
   A potential disadvantage of the adjacency-list representation is that it provides
no quicker way to determine whether a given edge .u; / is present in the graph
than to search for  in the adjacency list AdjŒu. An adjacency-matrix representa-
tion of the graph remedies this disadvantage, but at the cost of using asymptotically
more memory. (See Exercise 22.1-8 for suggestions of variations on adjacency lists
that permit faster edge lookup.)
   For the adjacency-matrix representation of a graph G D .V; E/, we assume
that the vertices are numbered 1; 2; : : : ; jV j in some arbitrary manner. Then the
adjacency-matrix representation of a graph G consists of a jV j jV j matrix
A D .aij / such that

          1 if .i; j / 2 E ;

          0 otherwise :
Figures 22.1(c) and 22.2(c) are the adjacency matrices of the undirected and di-
rected graphs in Figures 22.1(a) and 22.2(a), respectively. The adjacency matrix of
a graph requires ‚.V 2 / memory, independent of the number of edges in the graph.
   Observe the symmetry along the main diagonal of the adjacency matrix in Fig-
ure 22.1(c). Since in an undirected graph, .u; / and .; u/ represent the same
edge, the adjacency matrix A of an undirected graph is its own transpose: A D AT .
In some applications, it pays to store only the entries on and above the diagonal of
the adjacency matrix, thereby cutting the memory needed to store the graph almost
in half.
   Like the adjacency-list representation of a graph, an adjacency matrix can repre-
sent a weighted graph. For example, if G D .V; E/ is a weighted graph with edge-
weight function w, we can simply store the weight w.u; / of the edge .u; / 2 E
as the entry in row u and column  of the adjacency matrix. If an edge does not
exist, we can store a NIL value as its corresponding matrix entry, though for many
problems it is convenient to use a value such as 0 or 1.
   Although the adjacency-list representation is asymptotically at least as space-
efﬁcient as the adjacency-matrix representation, adjacency matrices are simpler,
and so we may prefer them when graphs are reasonably small. Moreover, adja-
