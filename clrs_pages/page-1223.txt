       Figure C.1 A geometric distribution with probability p D 1=3 of success and a probability
       q D 1  p of failure. The expectation of the distribution is 1=p D 3.


       important distributions arise from Bernoulli trials: the geometric distribution and
       the binomial distribution.

       The geometric distribution
       Suppose we have a sequence of Bernoulli trials, each with a probability p of suc-
       cess and a probability q D 1p of failure. How many trials occur before we obtain
       a success? Let us deﬁne the random variable X be the number of trials needed to
       obtain a success. Then X has values in the range f1; 2; : : :g, and for k  1,
       Pr fX D kg D q k1 p ;                                                            (C.31)
       since we have k  1 failures before the one success. A probability distribution sat-
       isfying equation (C.31) is said to be a geometric distribution. Figure C.1 illustrates
       such a distribution.
