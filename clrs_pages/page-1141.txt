1120   Chapter 35 Approximation Algorithms


          To show that G REEDY-S ET-C OVER is a .n/-approximation algorithm, we as-
       sign a cost of 1 to each set selected by the algorithm, distribute this cost over
       the elements covered for the ﬁrst time, and then use these costs to derive the de-
       sired relationship between the size of an optimal set cover C  and the size of the
       set cover C returned by the algorithm. Let Si denote the ith subset selected by
       G REEDY-S ET-C OVER; the algorithm incurs a cost of 1 when it adds Si to C . We
       spread this cost of selecting Si evenly among the elements covered for the ﬁrst time
       by Si . Let cx denote the cost allocated to element x, for each x 2 X . Each element
       is assigned a cost only once, when it is covered for the ﬁrst time. If x is covered
       for the ﬁrst time by Si , then
                             1
       cx D                                     :
              jSi  .S1 [ S2 [    [ Si 1 /j
       Each step of the algorithm assigns 1 unit of cost, and so
               X
       jC j D      cx :                                                               (35.9)
              x2X
       Each element x 2 X is in at least one set in the optimal cover C  , and so we have
       X X          X
               cx      cx :                                                        (35.10)
       S2C  x2S           x2X
       Combining equation (35.9) and inequality (35.10), we have that
              X X
       jC j        cx :                                                            (35.11)
              S2C  x2S
         The remainder of the proof rests on the following key inequality, which we shall
       prove shortly. For any set S belonging to the family F ,
       X
           cx  H.jSj/ :                                                          (35.12)
       x2S
       From inequalities (35.11) and (35.12), it follows that
                X
       jC j         H.jSj/
                   S2C 
              jC j  H.max fjSj W S 2 F g/ ;
                     


       thus proving the theorem.
         All that remains is to prove inequality (35.12). Consider any set S 2 F and any
       i D 1; 2; : : : ; jC j, and let
       ui D jS  .S1 [ S2 [    [ Si /j
       be the number of elements in S that remain uncovered after the algorithm has
       selected sets S1 ; S2 ; : : : ; Si . We deﬁne u0 D jSj to be the number of elements
