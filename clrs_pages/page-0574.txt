20.3 The van Emde Boas tree                                                      553


the cluster does not already have another element, then the element being inserted
becomes the only element in the cluster, and we do not need to recurse to insert an
element into an empty vEB tree:

V EB-E MPTY-T REE -I NSERT .V; x/
1 V:min D x
2 V:max D x
With this procedure in hand, here is the pseudocode for V EB-T REE -I NSERT .V; x/,
which assumes that x is not already an element in the set represented by vEB
tree V :

V EB-T REE -I NSERT .V; x/
 1   if V:min == NIL
 2        V EB-E MPTY-T REE -I NSERT .V; x/
 3   else if x < V:min
 4             exchange x with V:min
 5        if V:u > 2
 6             if V EB-T REE -M INIMUM .V:clusterŒhigh.x// == NIL
 7                  V EB-T REE -I NSERT .V:summary; high.x//
 8                  V EB-E MPTY-T REE -I NSERT .V:clusterŒhigh.x/; low.x//
 9             else V EB-T REE -I NSERT .V:clusterŒhigh.x/; low.x//
10        if x > V:max
11             V:max D x
   This procedure works as follows. Line 1 tests whether V is an empty vEB tree
and, if it is, then line 2 handles this easy case. Lines 3–11 assume that V is not
empty, and therefore some element will be inserted into one of V ’s clusters. But
that element might not necessarily be the element x passed to V EB-T REE -I NSERT.
If x < min, as tested in line 3, then x needs to become the new min. We don’t
want to lose the original min, however, and so we need to insert it into one of V ’s
clusters. In this case, line 4 exchanges x with min, so that we insert the original
min into one of V ’s clusters.
   We execute lines 6–9 only if V is not a base-case vEB tree. Line 6 determines
whether the cluster that x will go into is currently empty. If so, then line 7 in-
serts x’s cluster number into the summary and line 8 handles the easy case of
inserting x into an empty cluster. If x’s cluster is not currently empty, then line 9
inserts x into its cluster. In this case, we do not need to update the summary,
since x’s cluster number is already a member of the summary.
   Finally, lines 10–11 take care of updating max if x > max. Note that if V is a
base-case vEB tree that is not empty, then lines 3–4 and 10–11 update min and max
properly.
