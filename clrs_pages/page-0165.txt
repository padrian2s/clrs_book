      b. Suppose that there is exactly one index i such that AŒi D x. What is the
         expected number of indices into A that we must pick before we ﬁnd x and
         R ANDOM -S EARCH terminates?

      c. Generalizing your solution to part (b), suppose that there are k  1 indices i
         such that AŒi D x. What is the expected number of indices into A that we
         must pick before we ﬁnd x and R ANDOM -S EARCH terminates? Your answer
         should be a function of n and k.

      d. Suppose that there are no indices i such that AŒi D x. What is the expected
         number of indices into A that we must pick before we have checked all elements
         of A and R ANDOM -S EARCH terminates?

      Now consider a deterministic linear search algorithm, which we refer to as
      D ETERMINISTIC -S EARCH. Speciﬁcally, the algorithm searches A for x in order,
      considering AŒ1; AŒ2; AŒ3; : : : ; AŒn until either it ﬁnds AŒi D x or it reaches
      the end of the array. Assume that all possible permutations of the input array are
      equally likely.

      e. Suppose that there is exactly one index i such that AŒi D x. What is the
         average-case running time of D ETERMINISTIC -S EARCH? What is the worst-
         case running time of D ETERMINISTIC -S EARCH?

      f. Generalizing your solution to part (e), suppose that there are k  1 indices i
         such that AŒi D x. What is the average-case running time of D ETERMINISTIC -
         S EARCH? What is the worst-case running time of D ETERMINISTIC -S EARCH?
         Your answer should be a function of n and k.

      g. Suppose that there are no indices i such that AŒi D x. What is the average-case
         running time of D ETERMINISTIC -S EARCH? What is the worst-case running
         time of D ETERMINISTIC -S EARCH?

      Finally, consider a randomized algorithm S CRAMBLE -S EARCH that works by
      ﬁrst randomly permuting the input array and then running the deterministic lin-
      ear search given above on the resulting permuted array.

      h. Letting k be the number of indices i such that AŒi D x, give the worst-case and
         expected running times of S CRAMBLE -S EARCH for the cases in which k D 0
         and k D 1. Generalize your solution to handle the case in which k  1.

      i. Which of the three searching algorithms would you use? Explain your answer.
