       This ratio is greater than 1 precisely when .n C 1/p  k is positive. Conse-
       quently, b.kI n; p/ > b.k  1I n; p/ for k < .n C 1/p (the distribution increases),
       and b.kI n; p/ < b.k  1I n; p/ for k > .n C 1/p (the distribution decreases).
       If k D .n C 1/p is an integer, then b.kI n; p/ D b.k  1I n; p/, and so the distri-
       bution then has two maxima: at k D .nC1/p and at k1 D .nC1/p1 D np  q.
       Otherwise, it attains a maximum at the unique integer k that lies in the range
       np  q < k < .n C 1/p.
          The following lemma provides an upper bound on the binomial distribution.

       Lemma C.1
       Let n  0, let 0 < p < 1, let q D 1  p, and let 0  k  n. Then
                      np k  nq nk
       b.kI n; p/                       :
                        k     nk

       Proof    Using equation (C.6), we have
                            !
                          n k nk
       b.kI n; p/ D           p q

                         n k  n nk
                                         p k q nk
                          k     nk
                         np k  nq nk
                   D                        :
