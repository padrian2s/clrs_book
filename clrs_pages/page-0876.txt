29.1 Standard and slack forms                                                     855


be an inequality constraint. We introduce a new variable s and rewrite inequal-
ity (29.29) as the two constraints
              X
              n
s D bi              aij xj ;                                                 (29.30)
              j D1
s  0:                                                                        (29.31)
We call s a slack variable because it measures the slack, or difference, between
the left-hand and right-hand sides of equation (29.29). (We shall soon see why we
ﬁnd it convenient to write the constraint with only the slack variable on the left-
hand side.) Because inequality (29.29) is true if and only if both equation (29.30)
and inequality (29.31) are true, we can convert each inequality constraint of a lin-
ear program in this way to obtain an equivalent linear program in which the only
inequality constraints are the nonnegativity constraints. When converting from
standard to slack form, we shall use xnCi (instead of s) to denote the slack variable
associated with the ith inequality. The ith constraint is therefore
              X
              n
xnCi D bi           aij xj ;                                                 (29.32)
              j D1

along with the nonnegativity constraint xnCi  0.
   By converting each constraint of a linear program in standard form, we obtain a
linear program in a different form. For example, for the linear program described
in (29.24)–(29.28), we introduce slack variables x4 , x5 , and x6 , obtaining
maximize                              2x1      3x2   C 3x3                   (29.33)
subject to
              x4 D         7  x1              x2 C x3                       (29.34)
              x5 D 7 C x1                    C x2  x3                       (29.35)
              x6 D         4  x1             C 2x2  2x3                     (29.36)
                x1 ; x2 ; x3 ; x4 ; x5 ; x6      0 :                         (29.37)
In this linear program, all the constraints except for the nonnegativity constraints
are equalities, and each variable is subject to a nonnegativity constraint. We write
each equality constraint with one of the variables on the left-hand side of the equal-
ity and all others on the right-hand side. Furthermore, each equation has the same
set of variables on the right-hand side, and these variables are also the only ones
that appear in the objective function. We call the variables on the left-hand side of
the equalities basic variables and those on the right-hand side nonbasic variables.
   For linear programs that satisfy these conditions, we shall sometimes omit the
words “maximize” and “subject to,” as well as the explicit nonnegativity con-
straints. We shall also use the variable ´ to denote the value of the objective func-
