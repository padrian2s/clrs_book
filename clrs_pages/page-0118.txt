           4.6 Proof of the master theorem                                                        97


           4.5-2
           Professor Caesar wishes to develop a matrix-multiplication algorithm that is
           asymptotically faster than Strassen’s algorithm. His algorithm will use the divide-
           and-conquer method, dividing each matrix into pieces of size n=4 n=4, and the
           divide and combine steps together will take ‚.n2 / time. He needs to determine
           how many subproblems his algorithm has to create in order to beat Strassen’s algo-
           rithm. If his algorithm creates a subproblems, then the recurrence for the running
           time T .n/ becomes T .n/ D aT .n=4/ C ‚.n2 /. What is the largest integer value
           of a for which Professor Caesar’s algorithm would be asymptotically faster than
           Strassen’s algorithm?

           4.5-3
           Use the master method to show that the solution to the binary-search recurrence
           T .n/ D T .n=2/ C ‚.1/ is T .n/ D ‚.lg n/. (See Exercise 2.3-5 for a description
           of binary search.)

           4.5-4
           Can the master method be applied to the recurrence T .n/ D 4T .n=2/ C n2 lg n?
           Why or why not? Give an asymptotic upper bound for this recurrence.

           4.5-5 ?
           Consider the regularity condition af .n=b/  cf .n/ for some constant c < 1,
           which is part of case 3 of the master theorem. Give an example of constants a  1
           and b > 1 and a function f .n/ that satisﬁes all the conditions in case 3 of the
           master theorem except the regularity condition.



? 4.6 Proof of the master theorem

           This section contains a proof of the master theorem (Theorem 4.1). You do not
           need to understand the proof in order to apply the master theorem.
              The proof appears in two parts. The ﬁrst part analyzes the master recur-
           rence (4.20), under the simplifying assumption that T .n/ is deﬁned only on ex-
           act powers of b > 1, that is, for n D 1; b; b 2 ; : : :. This part gives all the intuition
           needed to understand why the master theorem is true. The second part shows how
           to extend the analysis to all positive integers n; it applies mathematical technique
           to the problem of handling ﬂoors and ceilings.
              In this section, we shall sometimes abuse our asymptotic notation slightly by
           using it to describe the behavior of functions that are deﬁned only over exact
           powers of b. Recall that the deﬁnitions of asymptotic notations require that
