Theorem C.4 and inequality (C.42) imply that the probability of fewer than k suc-
cesses is

Pr fX < kg D             b.iI n; p/ < b.kI n; p/ :

Thus we have

  Bounds on the right tail follow similarly. Exercise C.5-2 asks you to prove them.

Corollary C.6
Consider a sequence of n Bernoulli trials, where success occurs with probability p.
Let X be the random variable denoting the total number of successes. Then for
np < k < n, the probability of more than k successes is
                         X
                         n
Pr fX > kg D                  b.iI n; p/
                     i DkC1
                         .n  k/p
                <                 b.kI n; p/ :
                          k  np

Corollary C.7
Consider a sequence of n Bernoulli trials, where success occurs with probability p
and failure with probability q D 1  p. Then for .np C n/=2 < k < n, the
probability of more than k successes is less than one half of the probability of
more than k  1 successes.


  The next theorem considers n Bernoulli trials, each with a probability pi of
success, for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n. As the subsequent corollary shows, we can use the
