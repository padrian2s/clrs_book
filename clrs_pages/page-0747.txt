               Figure 26.6 The execution of the basic Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. (a)–(e) Successive iterations of
               the while loop. The left side of each part shows the residual network Gf from line 3 with a shaded
               augmenting path p. The right side of each part shows the new ﬂow f that results from augmenting f
               by fp . The residual network in (a) is the input network G.


                  When the capacities are integral and the optimal ﬂow value jf  j is small, the
               running time of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is good. Figure 26.7(a) shows an ex-
               ample of what can happen on a simple ﬂow network for which jf  j is large. A max-
               imum ﬂow in this network has value 2,000,000: 1,000,000 units of ﬂow traverse
               the path s ! u ! t, and another 1,000,000 units traverse the path s !  ! t . If
               the ﬁrst augmenting path found by F ORD -F ULKERSON is s ! u !  ! t , shown
               in Figure 26.7(a), the ﬂow has value 1 after the ﬁrst iteration. The resulting resid-
               ual network appears in Figure 26.7(b). If the second iteration ﬁnds the augment-
               ing path s !  ! u ! t, as shown in Figure 26.7(b), the ﬂow then has value 2.
               Figure 26.7(c) shows the resulting residual network. We can continue, choosing
               the augmenting path s ! u !  ! t in the odd-numbered iterations and the aug-
               menting path s !  ! u ! t in the even-numbered iterations. We would perform
               a total of 2,000,000 augmentations, increasing the ﬂow value by only 1 unit in each.
