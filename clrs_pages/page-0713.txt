      used in the shortest-paths algorithms correspond to in regular matrix multiplica-
      tion?

      25.1-4
      Show that matrix multiplication deﬁned by E XTEND -S HORTEST-PATHS is asso-
      ciative.

      25.1-5
      Show how to express the single-source shortest-paths problem as a product of ma-
      trices and a vector. Describe how evaluating this product corresponds to a Bellman-
      Ford-like algorithm (see Section 24.1).

      25.1-6
      Suppose we also wish to compute the vertices on shortest paths in the algorithms of
      this section. Show how to compute the predecessor matrix … from the completed
      matrix L of shortest-path weights in O.n3 / time.

      25.1-7
      We can also compute the vertices on shortest paths as we compute the shortest-
      path weights. Deﬁne ij.m/ as the predecessor of vertex j on any minimum-weight
      path from i to j that contains at most m edges. Modify the E XTEND -S HORTEST-
      PATHS and S LOW-A LL -PAIRS -S HORTEST-PATHS procedures to compute the ma-
      trices ….1/ ; ….2/ ; : : : ; ….n1/ as the matrices L.1/ ; L.2/ ; : : : ; L.n1/ are computed.

      25.1-8
      The FASTER -A LL -PAIRS -S HORTEST-PATHS procedure, as written, requires us to
      store dlg.n  1/e matrices, each with n2 elements, for a total space requirement of
      ‚.n2 lg n/. Modify the procedure to require only ‚.n2 / space by using only two
      n n matrices.

      25.1-9
      Modify FASTER -A LL -PAIRS -S HORTEST-PATHS so that it can determine whether
      the graph contains a negative-weight cycle.
