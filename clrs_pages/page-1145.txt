       Theorem 35.6
       Given an instance of MAX-3-CNF satisﬁability with n variables x1 ; x2 ; : : : ; xn
       and m clauses, the randomized algorithm that independently sets each vari-
       able to 1 with probability 1=2 and to 0 with probability 1=2 is a randomized
       8=7-approximation algorithm.

       Proof Suppose that we have independently set each variable to 1 with probabil-
       ity 1=2 and to 0 with probability 1=2. For i D 1; 2; : : : ; m, we deﬁne the indicator
       random variable
       Yi D I fclause i is satisﬁedg ;
       so that Yi D 1 as long as we have set at least one of the literals in the ith clause
       to 1. Since no literal appears more than once in the same clause, and since we have
       assumed that no variable and its negation appear in the same clause, the settings of
       the three literals in each clause are independent. A clause is not satisﬁed only if all
       three of its literals are set to 0, and so Pr fclause i is not satisﬁedg D .1=2/3 D 1=8.
       Thus, we have Pr fclause i is satisﬁedg D 1  1=8 D 7=8, and by Lemma 5.1,
       we have E ŒYi  D 7=8. Let Y be the number of satisﬁed clauses overall, so that
       Y D Y1 C Y2 C    C Ym . Then, we have
                        " m #
                         X
       E ŒY  D E             Yi
                           i D1
                   X
                   m
               D           E ŒYi    (by linearity of expectation)
                    i D1
                   X
                   m
               D           7=8
                    i D1
               D 7m=8 :
       Clearly, m is an upper bound on the number of satisﬁed clauses, and hence the
       approximation ratio is at most m=.7m=8/ D 8=7.

       Approximating weighted vertex cover using linear programming
       In the minimum-weight vertex-cover problem, we are given an undirected graph
       G D .V; E/ in which each vertex  2 V has an associated positive weight w./.
                                0                                                  0
       P any vertex cover V  V , we deﬁne the weight of the vertex cover w.V / D
       For
          2V 0 w./. The goal is to ﬁnd a vertex cover of minimum weight.
          We cannot apply the algorithm used for unweighted vertex cover, nor can we use
       a random solution; both methods may return solutions that are far from optimal.
       We shall, however, compute a lower bound on the weight of the minimum-weight
