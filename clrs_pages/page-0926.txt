30.1 Representing polynomials                                                     905


2. Evaluate: Compute point-value representations of A.x/ and B.x/ of length 2n
   by applying the FFT of order 2n on each polynomial. These representations
   contain the values of the two polynomials at the .2n/th roots of unity.
3. Pointwise multiply: Compute a point-value representation for the polynomial
   C.x/ D A.x/B.x/ by multiplying these values together pointwise. This repre-
   sentation contains the value of C.x/ at each .2n/th root of unity.
4. Interpolate: Create the coefﬁcient representation of the polynomial C.x/ by
   applying the FFT on 2n point-value pairs to compute the inverse DFT.
Steps (1) and (3) take time ‚.n/, and steps (2) and (4) take time ‚.n lg n/. Thus,
once we show how to use the FFT, we will have proven the following.

Theorem 30.2
We can multiply two polynomials of degree-bound n in time ‚.n lg n/, with both
the input and output representations in coefﬁcient form.


Exercises

30.1-1
Multiply the polynomials A.x/ D 7x 3  x 2 C x  10 and B.x/ D 8x 3  6x C 3
using equations (30.1) and (30.2).

30.1-2
Another way to evaluate a polynomial A.x/ of degree-bound n at a given point x0
is to divide A.x/ by the polynomial .x  x0 /, obtaining a quotient polynomial q.x/
of degree-bound n  1 and a remainder r, such that
A.x/ D q.x/.x  x0 / C r :
Clearly, A.x0 / D r. Show how to compute the remainder r and the coefﬁcients
of q.x/ in time ‚.n/ from x0 and the coefﬁcients of A.

30.1-4
Prove that n distinct point-value pairs are necessary to uniquely specify a polyno-
mial of degree-bound n, that is, if fewer than n distinct point-value pairs are given,
they fail to specify a unique polynomial of degree-bound n. (Hint: Using Theo-
rem 30.1, what can you say about a set of n  1 point-value pairs to which you add
one more arbitrarily chosen point-value pair?)
