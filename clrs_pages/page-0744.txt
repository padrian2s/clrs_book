Corollary 26.5
The value of any ﬂow f in a ﬂow network G is bounded from above by the capacity
of any cut of G.

Proof Let .S; T / be any cut of G and let f be any ﬂow. By Lemma 26.4 and the
capacity constraint,

   Corollary 26.5 yields the immediate consequence that the value of a maximum
ﬂow in a network is bounded from above by the capacity of a minimum cut of
the network. The important max-ﬂow min-cut theorem, which we now state and
prove, says that the value of a maximum ﬂow is in fact equal to the capacity of a
minimum cut.

Theorem 26.6 (Max-ﬂow min-cut theorem)
If f is a ﬂow in a ﬂow network G D .V; E/ with source s and sink t, then the
following conditions are equivalent:
1. f is a maximum ﬂow in G.
2. The residual network Gf contains no augmenting paths.
3. jf j D c.S; T / for some cut .S; T / of G.

Proof .1/ ) .2/: Suppose for the sake of contradiction that f is a maximum
ﬂow in G but that Gf has an augmenting path p. Then, by Corollary 26.3, the
ﬂow found by augmenting f by fp , where fp is given by equation (26.8), is a ﬂow
in G with value strictly greater than jf j, contradicting the assumption that f is a
maximum ﬂow.
   .2/ ) .3/: Suppose that Gf has no augmenting path, that is, that Gf contains
no path from s to t. Deﬁne
S D f 2 V W there exists a path from s to  in Gf g
and T D V  S. The partition .S; T / is a cut: we have s 2 S trivially and t 62 S
because there is no path from s to t in Gf . Now consider a pair of vertices
