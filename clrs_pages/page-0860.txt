28.3 Symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrices and least-squares approximation      839


F .x/ D 1:200  0:757x C 0:214x 2
as the closest-ﬁtting quadratic to the given data, in a least-squares sense.
   As a practical matter, we solve the normal equation (28.19) by multiplying y
by AT and then ﬁnding an LU decomposition of AT A. If A has full rank, the
matrix AT A is guaranteed to be nonsingular, because it is symmetric and positive-
deﬁnite. (See Exercise D.1-2 and Theorem D.6.)

Exercises

28.3-1
Prove that every diagonal element of a symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrix is posi-
tive.

28.3-2            
             a b
Let A D              be a 2 2 symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrix. Prove that its
             b c
determinant ac  b 2 is positive by “completing the square” in a manner similar to
that used in the proof of Lemma 28.5.

28.3-3
Prove that the maximum element in a symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrix lies on
the diagonal.

28.3-4
Prove that the determinant of each leading submatrix of a symmetric positive-
deﬁnite matrix is positive.

28.3-5
Let Ak denote the kth leading submatrix of a symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrix A.
Prove that det.Ak /= det.Ak1 / is the kth pivot during LU decomposition, where,
by convention, det.A0 / D 1.
