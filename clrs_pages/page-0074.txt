           3.1-3
           Explain why the statement, “The running time of algorithm A is at least O.n2 /,” is
           meaningless.

           3.1-4
           Is 2nC1 D O.2n /? Is 22n D O.2n /?

           3.1-5
           Prove Theorem 3.1.

           3.1-6
           Prove that the running time of an algorithm is ‚.g.n// if and only if its worst-case
           running time is O.g.n// and its best-case running time is .g.n//.

           3.1-7
           Prove that o.g.n// \ !.g.n// is the empty set.

           3.1-8
           We can extend our notation to the case of two parameters n and m that can go to
           inﬁnity independently at different rates. For a given function g.n; m/, we denote
           by O.g.n; m// the set of functions
           O.g.n; m// D ff .n; m/ W there exist positive constants c, n0 , and m0
                                    such that 0  f .n; m/  cg.n; m/
                                    for all n  n0 or m  m0 g :
           Give corresponding deﬁnitions for .g.n; m// and ‚.g.n; m//.



3.2 Standard notations and common functions

           This section reviews some standard mathematical functions and notations and ex-
           plores the relationships among them. It also illustrates the use of the asymptotic
           notations.

           Monotonicity
           A function f .n/ is monotonically increasing if m  n implies f .m/  f .n/.
           Similarly, it is monotonically decreasing if m  n implies f .m/  f .n/. A
           function f .n/ is strictly increasing if m < n implies f .m/ < f .n/ and strictly
           decreasing if m < n implies f .m/ > f .n/.
