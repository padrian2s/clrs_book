              Figure 30.1 A graphical outline of an efﬁcient polynomial-multiplication process. Representations
              on the top are in coefﬁcient form, while those on the bottom are in point-value form. The arrows
              from left to right correspond to the multiplication operation. The !2n terms are complex .2n/th roots
              of unity.


              on whether we can convert a polynomial quickly from coefﬁcient form to point-
              value form (evaluate) and vice versa (interpolate).
                 We can use any points we want as evaluation points, but by choosing the eval-
              uation points carefully, we can convert between representations in only ‚.n lg n/
              time. As we shall see in Section 30.2, if we choose “complex roots of unity” as
              the evaluation points, we can produce a point-value representation by taking the
              discrete Fourier transform (or DFT) of a coefﬁcient vector. We can perform the
              inverse operation, interpolation, by taking the “inverse DFT” of point-value pairs,
              yielding a coefﬁcient vector. Section 30.2 will show how the FFT accomplishes
              the DFT and inverse DFT operations in ‚.n lg n/ time.
                 Figure 30.1 shows this strategy graphically. One minor detail concerns degree-
              bounds. The product of two polynomials of degree-bound n is a polynomial of
              degree-bound 2n. Before evaluating the input polynomials A and B, therefore,
              we ﬁrst double their degree-bounds to 2n by adding n high-order coefﬁcients of 0.
              Because the vectors have 2n elements, we use “complex .2n/th roots of unity,”
              which are denoted by the !2n terms in Figure 30.1.
                 Given the FFT, we have the following ‚.n lg n/-time procedure for multiplying
              two polynomials A.x/ and B.x/ of degree-bound n, where the input and output
              representations are in coefﬁcient form. We assume that n is a power of 2; we can
              always meet this requirement by adding high-order zero coefﬁcients.
              1. Double degree-bound: Create coefﬁcient representations of A.x/ and B.x/ as
                 degree-bound 2n polynomials by adding n high-order zero coefﬁcients to each.
