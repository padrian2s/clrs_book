     Figure B.2 Directed and undirected graphs. (a) A directed graph G D .V; E/, where V D
     f1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6g and E D f.1; 2/; .2; 2/; .2; 4/; .2; 5/; .4; 1/; .4; 5/; .5; 4/; .6; 3/g. The edge .2; 2/
     is a self-loop. (b) An undirected graph G D .V; E/, where V D f1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6g and E D
     f.1; 2/; .1; 5/; .2; 5/; .3; 6/g. The vertex 4 is isolated. (c) The subgraph of the graph in part (a)
     induced by the vertex set f1; 2; 3; 6g.


     u;  2 V and u ¤ . By convention, we use the notation .u; / for an edge, rather
     than the set notation fu; g, and we consider .u; / and .; u/ to be the same edge.
     In an undirected graph, self-loops are forbidden, and so every edge consists of two
     distinct vertices. Figure B.2(b) is a pictorial representation of an undirected graph
     on the vertex set f1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6g.
         Many deﬁnitions for directed and undirected graphs are the same, although cer-
     tain terms have slightly different meanings in the two contexts. If .u; / is an edge
     in a directed graph G D .V; E/, we say that .u; / is incident from or leaves
     vertex u and is incident to or enters vertex . For example, the edges leaving ver-
     tex 2 in Figure B.2(a) are .2; 2/, .2; 4/, and .2; 5/. The edges entering vertex 2 are
     .1; 2/ and .2; 2/. If .u; / is an edge in an undirected graph G D .V; E/, we say
     that .u; / is incident on vertices u and . In Figure B.2(b), the edges incident on
     vertex 2 are .1; 2/ and .2; 5/.
         If .u; / is an edge in a graph G D .V; E/, we say that vertex  is adjacent to
     vertex u. When the graph is undirected, the adjacency relation is symmetric. When
     the graph is directed, the adjacency relation is not necessarily symmetric. If  is
     adjacent to u in a directed graph, we sometimes write u ! . In parts (a) and (b)
     of Figure B.2, vertex 2 is adjacent to vertex 1, since the edge .1; 2/ belongs to both
     graphs. Vertex 1 is not adjacent to vertex 2 in Figure B.2(a), since the edge .2; 1/
     does not belong to the graph.
         The degree of a vertex in an undirected graph is the number of edges incident on
     it. For example, vertex 2 in Figure B.2(b) has degree 2. A vertex whose degree is 0,
     such as vertex 4 in Figure B.2(b), is isolated. In a directed graph, the out-degree
     of a vertex is the number of edges leaving it, and the in-degree of a vertex is the
     number of edges entering it. The degree of a vertex in a directed graph is its in-
