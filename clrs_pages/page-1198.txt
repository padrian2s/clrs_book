  Figure B.6 Rooted and ordered trees. (a) A rooted tree with height 4. The tree is drawn in a
  standard way: the root (node 7) is at the top, its children (nodes with depth 1) are beneath it, their
  children (nodes with depth 2) are beneath them, and so forth. If the tree is ordered, the relative left-
  to-right order of the children of a node matters; otherwise it doesn’t. (b) Another rooted tree. As a
  rooted tree, it is identical to the tree in (a), but as an ordered tree it is different, since the children of
  node 3 appear in a different order.


     The number of children of a node x in a rooted tree T equals the degree of x.6
  The length of the simple path from the root r to a node x is the depth of x in T .
  A level of a tree consists of all nodes at the same depth. The height of a node in a
  tree is the number of edges on the longest simple downward path from the node to
  a leaf, and the height of a tree is the height of its root. The height of a tree is also
  equal to the largest depth of any node in the tree.
     An ordered tree is a rooted tree in which the children of each node are ordered.
  That is, if a node has k children, then there is a ﬁrst child, a second child, . . . ,
  and a kth child. The two trees in Figure B.6 are different when considered to be
  ordered trees, but the same when considered to be just rooted trees.

  B.5.3 Binary and positional trees
  We deﬁne binary trees recursively. A binary tree T is a structure deﬁned on a ﬁnite
  set of nodes that either
     contains no nodes, or


  6 Notice that the degree of a node depends on whether we consider T to be a rooted tree or a free tree.

  The degree of a vertex in a free tree is, as in any undirected graph, the number of adjacent vertices.
  In a rooted tree, however, the degree is the number of children—the parent of a node does not count
  toward its degree.
