           In the proof of Lemma 29.5, we argued that there are at most mCn
                                                                          n

           a set B of basic variables. Give an example of a linear program in which there are
           strictly fewer than mCn

29.4 Duality

           We have proven that, under certain assumptions, S IMPLEX terminates. We have not
           yet shown that it actually ﬁnds an optimal solution to a linear program, however.
           In order to do so, we introduce a powerful concept called linear-programming
           duality.
              Duality enables us to prove that a solution is indeed optimal. We saw an exam-
           ple of duality in Chapter 26 with Theorem 26.6, the max-ﬂow min-cut theorem.
           Suppose that, given an instance of a maximum-ﬂow problem, we ﬁnd a ﬂow f
           with value jf j. How do we know whether f is a maximum ﬂow? By the max-ﬂow
           min-cut theorem, if we can ﬁnd a cut whose value is also jf j, then we have ver-
           iﬁed that f is indeed a maximum ﬂow. This relationship provides an example of
           duality: given a maximization problem, we deﬁne a related minimization problem
           such that the two problems have the same optimal objective values.
              Given a linear program in which the objective is to maximize, we shall describe
           how to formulate a dual linear program in which the objective is to minimize and
