96   Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer


     f .n/ D n lg n is asymptotically larger than nlogb a D n. The problem is that it
     is not polynomially larger. The ratio f .n/=nlogb a D .n lg n/=n D lg n is asymp-
     totically less than n for any positive constant . Consequently, the recurrence falls
     into the gap between case 2 and case 3. (See Exercise 4.6-2 for a solution.)
        Let’s use the master method to solve the recurrences we saw in Sections 4.1
     and 4.2. Recurrence (4.7),
     T .n/ D 2T .n=2/ C ‚.n/ ;
     characterizes the running times of the divide-and-conquer algorithm for both the
     maximum-subarray problem and merge sort. (As is our practice, we omit stating
     the base case in the recurrence.) Here, we have a D 2, b D 2, f .n/ D ‚.n/, and
     thus we have that nlogb a D nlog2 2 D n. Case 2 applies, since f .n/ D ‚.n/, and so
     we have the solution T .n/ D ‚.n lg n/.
        Recurrence (4.17),
     T .n/ D 8T .n=2/ C ‚.n2 / ;
     describes the running time of the ﬁrst divide-and-conquer algorithm that we saw
     for matrix multiplication. Now we have a D 8, b D 2, and f .n/ D ‚.n2 /,
     and so nlogb a D nlog2 8 D n3 . Since n3 is polynomially larger than f .n/ (that is,
     f .n/ D O.n3 / for  D 1), case 1 applies, and T .n/ D ‚.n3 /.
        Finally, consider recurrence (4.18),
     T .n/ D 7T .n=2/ C ‚.n2 / ;
     which describes the running time of Strassen’s algorithm. Here, we have a D 7,
     b D 2, f .n/ D ‚.n2 /, and thus nlogb a D nlog2 7 . Rewriting log2 7 as lg 7 and
     recalling that 2:80 < lg 7 < 2:81, we see that f .n/ D O.nlg 7 / for  D 0:8.
     Again, case 1 applies, and we have the solution T .n/ D ‚.nlg 7 /.
