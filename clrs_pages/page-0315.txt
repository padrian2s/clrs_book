294         Chapter 12 Binary Search Trees


            12.2-8
            Prove that no matter what node we start at in a height-h binary search tree, k
            successive calls to T REE -S UCCESSOR take O.k C h/ time.

            12.2-9
            Let T be a binary search tree whose keys are distinct, let x be a leaf node, and let y
            be its parent. Show that y:key is either the smallest key in T larger than x:key or
            the largest key in T smaller than x:key.



12.3 Insertion and deletion

            The operations of insertion and deletion cause the dynamic set represented by a
            binary search tree to change. The data structure must be modiﬁed to reﬂect this
            change, but in such a way that the binary-search-tree property continues to hold.
            As we shall see, modifying the tree to insert a new element is relatively straight-
            forward, but handling deletion is somewhat more intricate.

            Insertion
            To insert a new value  into a binary search tree T , we use the procedure T REE -
            I NSERT. The procedure takes a node ´ for which ´:key D , ´:left D NIL,
            and ´:right D NIL . It modiﬁes T and some of the attributes of ´ in such a way that
            it inserts ´ into an appropriate position in the tree.

            T REE -I NSERT .T; ´/
             1 y D NIL
             2 x D T:root
             3 while x ¤ NIL
             4        y Dx
             5        if ´:key < x:key
             6             x D x:left
             7        else x D x:right
             8 ´:p D y
             9 if y == NIL
            10        T:root D ´       // tree T was empty
            11 elseif ´:key < y:key
            12        y:left D ´
            13 else y:right D ´
