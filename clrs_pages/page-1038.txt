is counterclockwise.

Determining whether consecutive segments turn left or right
Our next question is whether two consecutive line segments p0 p1 and p1 p2 turn
left or right at point p1 . Equivalently, we want a method to determine which way a
given angle †p0 p1 p2 turns. Cross products allow us to answer this question with-
out computing the angle. As Figure 33.2 shows, we simply check whether directed
segment       p2 is clockwise or counterclockwise relative to directed segment 
           p0!                                                                 p0p
                                                                                     !.
                                                                                       1
To do so, we compute the cross product .p2  p0 / .p1  p0 /. If the sign of
this cross product is negative, then     p2 is counterclockwise with respect to 
                                      p0!                                      p0p
                                                                                     !,
                                                                                       1
and thus we make a left turn at p1 . A positive cross product indicates a clockwise
orientation and a right turn. A cross product of 0 means that points p0 , p1 , and p2
are colinear.

Determining whether two line segments intersect
To determine whether two line segments intersect, we check whether each segment
straddles the line containing the other. A segment p1 p2 straddles a line if point p1
lies on one side of the line and point p2 lies on the other side. A boundary case
arises if p1 or p2 lies directly on the line. Two line segments intersect if and only
if either (or both) of the following conditions holds:
1. Each segment straddles the line containing the other.
2. An endpoint of one segment lies on the other segment. (This condition comes
   from the boundary case.)
