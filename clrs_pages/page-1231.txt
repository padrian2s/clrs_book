       Corollary C.5
       Consider a sequence of n Bernoulli trials, where success occurs with probability p
       and failure with probability q D 1  p. Then for 0 < k  np=2, the probability of
       fewer than k successes is less than one half of the probability of fewer than k C 1
       successes.

       Proof       Because k  np=2, we have
         kq                .np=2/q
