     bounds be proved for all sufﬁciently large numbers, not just those that are pow-
     ers of b. Since we could make new asymptotic notations that apply only to the set
     fb i W i D 0; 1; 2; : : :g, instead of to the nonnegative numbers, this abuse is minor.
        Nevertheless, we must always be on guard when we use asymptotic notation over
     a limited domain lest we draw improper conclusions. For example, proving that
     T .n/ D O.n/ when n is an exact power of 2 does not guarantee that T .n/ D O.n/.
     The function T .n/ could be deﬁned as
               (
                 n if n D 1; 2; 4; 8; : : : ;
     T .n/ D
                 n2 otherwise ;
     in which case the best upper bound that applies to all values of n is T .n/ D O.n2 /.
     Because of this sort of drastic consequence, we shall never use asymptotic notation
     over a limited domain without making it absolutely clear from the context that we
     are doing so.

     4.6.1   The proof for exact powers
     The ﬁrst part of the proof of the master theorem analyzes the recurrence (4.20)
     T .n/ D aT .n=b/ C f .n/ ;
     for the master method, under the assumption that n is an exact power of b > 1,
     where b need not be an integer. We break the analysis into three lemmas. The ﬁrst
     reduces the problem of solving the master recurrence to the problem of evaluating
     an expression that contains a summation. The second determines bounds on this
     summation. The third lemma puts the ﬁrst two together to prove a version of the
     master theorem for the case in which n is an exact power of b.

     Lemma 4.2
     Let a  1 and b > 1 be constants, and let f .n/ be a nonnegative function deﬁned
     on exact powers of b. Deﬁne T .n/ on exact powers of b by the recurrence
             (
               ‚.1/               if n D 1 ;
     T .n/ D
               aT .n=b/ C f .n/ if n D b i ;
     where i is a positive integer. Then
                                  X
                                 logb n1
                   logb a
     T .n/ D ‚.n            /C              aj f .n=b j / :                          (4.21)

     Proof We use the recursion tree in Figure 4.7. The root of the tree has cost f .n/,
     and it has a children, each with cost f .n=b/. (It is convenient to think of a as being
