         Figure 26.2 Converting a network with antiparallel edges to an equivalent one with no antiparallel
         edges. (a) A ﬂow network containing both the edges .1 ; 2 / and .2 ; 1 /. (b) An equivalent network
         with no antiparallel edges. We add the new vertex  0 , and we replace edge .1 ; 2 / by the pair of
         edges .1 ;  0 / and . 0 ; 2 /, both with the same capacity as .1 ; 2 /.


         Puck leases space on trucks from another ﬁrm to ship the pucks from the factory
         to the warehouse. Because the trucks travel over speciﬁed routes (edges) between
         cities (vertices) and have a limited capacity, Lucky Puck can ship at most c.u; /
         crates per day between each pair of cities u and  in Figure 26.1(a). Lucky Puck
         has no control over these routes and capacities, and so the company cannot alter
         the ﬂow network shown in Figure 26.1(a). They need to determine the largest
         number p of crates per day that they can ship and then to produce this amount, since
         there is no point in producing more pucks than they can ship to their warehouse.
         Lucky Puck is not concerned with how long it takes for a given puck to get from
         the factory to the warehouse; they care only that p crates per day leave the factory
         and p crates per day arrive at the warehouse.
            We can model the “ﬂow” of shipments with a ﬂow in this network because the
         number of crates shipped per day from one city to another is subject to a capacity
         constraint. Additionally, the model must obey ﬂow conservation, for in a steady
         state, the rate at which pucks enter an intermediate city must equal the rate at which
         they leave. Otherwise, crates would accumulate at intermediate cities.

         Modeling problems with antiparallel edges
         Suppose that the trucking ﬁrm offered Lucky Puck the opportunity to lease space
         for 10 crates in trucks going from Edmonton to Calgary. It would seem natural to
         add this opportunity to our example and form the network shown in Figure 26.2(a).
         This network suffers from one problem, however: it violates our original assump-
         tion that if an edge .1 ; 2 / 2 E, then .2 ; 1 / 62 E. We call the two edges .1 ; 2 /
         and .2 ; 1 / antiparallel. Thus, if we wish to model a ﬂow problem with antipar-
         allel edges, we must transform the network into an equivalent one containing no
