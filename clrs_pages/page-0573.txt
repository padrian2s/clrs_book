         The V EB-T REE -P REDECESSOR procedure is symmetric to the V EB-T REE -
      S UCCESSOR procedure, but with one additional case:

      V EB-T REE -P REDECESSOR .V; x/
       1 if V:u == 2
       2      if x == 1 and V:min == 0
       3           return 0
       4      else return NIL
       5 elseif V:max ¤ NIL and x > V:max
       6      return V:max
       7 else min-low D V EB-T REE -M INIMUM .V:clusterŒhigh.x//
       8      if min-low ¤ NIL and low.x/ > min-low
       9           offset D V EB-T REE -P REDECESSOR .V:clusterŒhigh.x/; low.x//
      10           return index.high.x/; offset/
      11      else pred-cluster D V EB-T REE -P REDECESSOR .V:summary; high.x//
      12           if pred-cluster == NIL
      13                if V:min ¤ NIL and x > V:min
      14                     return V:min
      15                else return NIL
      16           else offset D V EB-T REE -M AXIMUM .V:clusterŒpred-cluster/
      17                return index.pred-cluster; offset/

         Lines 13–14 form the additional case. This case occurs when x’s predecessor,
      if it exists, does not reside in x’s cluster. In V EB-T REE -S UCCESSOR, we were
      assured that if x’s successor resides outside of x’s cluster, then it must reside in
      a higher-numbered cluster. But if x’s predecessor is the minimum value in vEB
      tree V , then the successor resides in no cluster at all. Line 13 checks for this
      condition, and line 14 returns the minimum value as appropriate.
         This extra case does not affect the asymptotic running time of V EB-T REE -
      P REDECESSOR when compared with V EB-T REE -S UCCESSOR, and so V EB-
      T REE -P REDECESSOR runs in O.lg lg u/ worst-case time.

      Inserting an element
      Now we examine how to insert an element into a vEB tree. Recall that P ROTO -
      V EB-I NSERT made two recursive calls: one to insert the element and one to insert
      the element’s cluster number into the summary. The V EB-T REE -I NSERT proce-
      dure will make only one recursive call. How can we get away with just one? When
      we insert an element, either the cluster that it goes into already has another element
      or it does not. If the cluster already has another element, then the cluster number
      is already in the summary, and so we do not need to make that recursive call. If
