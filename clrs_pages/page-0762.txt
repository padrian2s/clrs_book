26.4 Push-relabel algorithms                                                     741


  I NITIALIZE -P REFLOW creates an initial preﬂow f deﬁned by
           (
             c.u; / if u D s ;
.u; /:f D                                                                   (26.15)
             0       otherwise :
That is, we ﬁll to capacity each edge leaving the source s, and all other edges carry
no ﬂow. For each vertex  adjacent to the source, we initially have :e D c.s; /,
and we initialize s:e to the negative of the sum of these capacities. The generic
algorithm also begins with an initial height function h, given by
        (
          jV j if u D s ;
u:h D                                                                        (26.16)
          0     otherwise :
Equation (26.16) deﬁnes a height function because the only edges .u; / for which
u:h > :h C 1 are those for which u D s, and those edges are saturated, which
means that they are not in the residual network.
   Initialization, followed by a sequence of push and relabel operations, executed
in no particular order, yields the G ENERIC -P USH -R ELABEL algorithm:

2 while there exists an applicable push or relabel operation
3      select an applicable push or relabel operation and perform it

The following lemma tells us that as long as an overﬂowing vertex exists, at least
one of the two basic operations applies.

Lemma 26.14 (An overﬂowing vertex can be either pushed or relabeled)
Let G D .V; E/ be a ﬂow network with source s and sink t, let f be a preﬂow,
and let h be any height function for f . If u is any overﬂowing vertex, then either a
push or relabel operation applies to it.

Proof For any residual edge .u; /, we have h.u/  h./ C 1 because h is a
height function. If a push operation does not apply to an overﬂowing vertex u,
then for all residual edges .u; /, we must have h.u/ < h./ C 1, which implies
h.u/  h./. Thus, a relabel operation applies to u.

Correctness of the push-relabel method
To show that the generic push-relabel algorithm solves the maximum-ﬂow prob-
lem, we shall ﬁrst prove that if it terminates, the preﬂow f is a maximum ﬂow.
We shall later prove that it terminates. We start with some observations about the
height function h.
