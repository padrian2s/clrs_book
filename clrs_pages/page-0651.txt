630   Chapter 23 Minimum Spanning Trees


      23.1-6
      Show that a graph has a unique minimum spanning tree if, for every cut of the
      graph, there is a unique light edge crossing the cut. Show that the converse is not
      true by giving a counterexample.

      23.1-7
      Argue that if all edge weights of a graph are positive, then any subset of edges that
      connects all vertices and has minimum total weight must be a tree. Give an example
      to show that the same conclusion does not follow if we allow some weights to be
      nonpositive.

      23.1-8
      Let T be a minimum spanning tree of a graph G, and let L be the sorted list of the
      edge weights of T . Show that for any other minimum spanning tree T 0 of G, the
      list L is also the sorted list of edge weights of T 0 .

      23.1-9
      Let T be a minimum spanning tree of a graph G D .V; E/, and let V 0 be a subset
      of V . Let T 0 be the subgraph of T induced by V 0 , and let G 0 be the subgraph of G
      induced by V 0 . Show that if T 0 is connected, then T 0 is a minimum spanning tree
      of G 0 .

      23.1-10
      Given a graph G and a minimum spanning tree T , suppose that we decrease the
      weight of one of the edges in T . Show that T is still a minimum spanning tree
      for G. More formally, let T be a minimum spanning tree for G with edge weights
      given by weight function w. Choose one edge .x; y/ 2 T and a positive number k,
      and deﬁne the weight function w 0 by
                   (
                     w.u; /      if .u; / ¤ .x; y/ ;
      w 0 .u; / D
                     w.x; y/  k if .u; / D .x; y/ :

      Show that T is a minimum spanning tree for G with edge weights given by w 0 .

      23.1-11 ?
      Given a graph G and a minimum spanning tree T , suppose that we decrease the
      weight of one of the edges not in T . Give an algorithm for ﬁnding the minimum
      spanning tree in the modiﬁed graph.
