Corollary 23.2
Let G D .V; E/ be a connected, undirected graph with a real-valued weight func-
tion w deﬁned on E. Let A be a subset of E that is included in some minimum
spanning tree for G, and let C D .VC ; EC / be a connected component (tree) in the
forest GA D .V; A/. If .u; / is a light edge connecting C to some other component
in GA , then .u; / is safe for A.

Proof The cut .VC ; V  VC / respects A, and .u; / is a light edge for this cut.
Therefore, .u; / is safe for A.

Exercises

23.1-1
Let .u; / be a minimum-weight edge in a connected graph G. Show that .u; /
belongs to some minimum spanning tree of G.

23.1-2
Professor Sabatier conjectures the following converse of Theorem 23.1. Let G D
.V; E/ be a connected, undirected graph with a real-valued weight function w de-
ﬁned on E. Let A be a subset of E that is included in some minimum spanning
tree for G, let .S; V  S/ be any cut of G that respects A, and let .u; / be a safe
edge for A crossing .S; V  S/. Then, .u; / is a light edge for the cut. Show that
the professor’s conjecture is incorrect by giving a counterexample.

23.1-3
Show that if an edge .u; / is contained in some minimum spanning tree, then it is
a light edge crossing some cut of the graph.

23.1-4
Give a simple example of a connected graph such that the set of edges f.u; / W
there exists a cut .S; V  S/ such that .u; / is a light edge crossing .S; V  S/g
does not form a minimum spanning tree.

23.1-5
Let e be a maximum-weight edge on some cycle of connected graph G D .V; E/.
Prove that there is a minimum spanning tree of G 0 D .V; E  feg/ that is also a
minimum spanning tree of G. That is, there is a minimum spanning tree of G that
does not include e.
