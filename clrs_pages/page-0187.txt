           6.5-5
           Argue the correctness of H EAP -I NCREASE -K EY using the following loop invari-
           ant:

              At the start of each iteration of the while loop of lines 4–6, the subarray
              AŒ1 : : A:heap-size satisﬁes the max-heap property, except that there may
              be one violation: AŒi may be larger than AŒPARENT.i/.

           You may assume that the subarray AŒ1 : : A:heap-size satisﬁes the max-heap prop-
           erty at the time H EAP -I NCREASE -K EY is called.

           6.5-6
           Each exchange operation on line 5 of H EAP -I NCREASE -K EY typically requires
           three assignments. Show how to use the idea of the inner loop of I NSERTION -
           S ORT to reduce the three assignments down to just one assignment.

           6.5-7
           Show how to implement a ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out queue with a priority queue. Show
           how to implement a stack with a priority queue. (Queues and stacks are deﬁned in
           Section 10.1.)

           6.5-8
           The operation H EAP -D ELETE .A; i/ deletes the item in node i from heap A. Give
           an implementation of H EAP -D ELETE that runs in O.lg n/ time for an n-element
           max-heap.

           6.5-9
           Give an O.n lg k/-time algorithm to merge k sorted lists into one sorted list,
           where n is the total number of elements in all the input lists. (Hint: Use a min-
           heap for k-way merging.)

           6-1 Building a heap using insertion
           We can build a heap by repeatedly calling M AX -H EAP -I NSERT to insert the ele-
           ments into the heap. Consider the following variation on the B UILD -M AX -H EAP
           procedure:
