28.3 Symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrices and least-squares approximation          833


prove several other important properties of symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrices
and show an interesting application to curve ﬁtting by a least-squares approxima-
tion.
   The ﬁrst property we prove is perhaps the most basic.

Lemma 28.3
Any positive-deﬁnite matrix is nonsingular.

Proof Suppose that a matrix A is singular. Then by Corollary D.3, there exists a
nonzero vector x such that Ax D 0. Hence, x T Ax D 0, and A cannot be positive-
deﬁnite.

   The proof that we can perform LU decomposition on a symmetric positive-
deﬁnite matrix A without dividing by 0 is more involved. We begin by proving
properties about certain submatrices of A. Deﬁne the kth leading submatrix of A
to be the matrix Ak consisting of the intersection of the ﬁrst k rows and ﬁrst k
columns of A.

Lemma 28.4
If A is a symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrix, then every leading submatrix of A is
symmetric and positive-deﬁnite.

Proof That each leading submatrix Ak is symmetric is obvious. To prove that Ak
is positive-deﬁnite, we assume that it is not and derive a contradiction. If Ak is not
positive-deﬁnite, then there exists a k-vector xk ¤ 0 such that xkT Ak xk  0. Let A
be n n, and
                
         Ak B T
AD                                                                            (28.14)
         B C
for submatrices B (which is .n  k/ k) and C (which is .n  k/ .n  k/). Deﬁne
the n-vector x D . xkT 0 /T , where n  k 0s follow xk . Then we have
                                     
  T             T       Ak B T       xk
x Ax D . xk 0 /
                        B C           0
                              
                        Ak xk
        D . xkT 0 /
                        Bxk
         D xkT Ak xk
          0;
which contradicts A being positive-deﬁnite.
