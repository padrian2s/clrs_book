            this chapter and Chapter 23 independently of each other, you might ﬁnd it useful
            to read them together.


16.1 An activity-selection problem

            Our ﬁrst example is the problem of scheduling several competing activities that re-
            quire exclusive use of a common resource, with a goal of selecting a maximum-size
            set of mutually compatible activities. Suppose we have a set S D fa1 ; a2 ; : : : ; an g
            of n proposed activities that wish to use a resource, such as a lecture hall, which
            can serve only one activity at a time. Each activity ai has a start time si and a ﬁnish
            time fi , where 0  si < fi < 1. If selected, activity ai takes place during the
            half-open time interval Œsi ; fi /. Activities ai and aj are compatible if the intervals
            Œsi ; fi / and Œsj ; fj / do not overlap. That is, ai and aj are compatible if si  fj
            or sj  fi . In the activity-selection problem, we wish to select a maximum-size
            subset of mutually compatible activities. We assume that the activities are sorted
            in monotonically increasing order of ﬁnish time:
            f1  f2  f3      fn1  fn :                                                 (16.1)
            (We shall see later the advantage that this assumption provides.) For example,
            consider the following set S of activities:
            i    1   2   3    4   5   6     7    8     9   10   11
            si   1   3   0    5   3   5     6    8     8    2   12
            fi   4   5   6    7   9   9    10    11   12   14   16

            For this example, the subset fa3 ; a9 ; a11 g consists of mutually compatible activities.
            It is not a maximum subset, however, since the subset fa1 ; a4 ; a8 ; a11 g is larger. In
            fact, fa1 ; a4 ; a8 ; a11 g is a largest subset of mutually compatible activities; another
            largest subset is fa2 ; a4 ; a9 ; a11 g.
                We shall solve this problem in several steps. We start by thinking about a
            dynamic-programming solution, in which we consider several choices when deter-
            mining which subproblems to use in an optimal solution. We shall then observe that
            we need to consider only one choice—the greedy choice—and that when we make
            the greedy choice, only one subproblem remains. Based on these observations, we
            shall develop a recursive greedy algorithm to solve the activity-scheduling prob-
            lem. We shall complete the process of developing a greedy solution by converting
            the recursive algorithm to an iterative one. Although the steps we shall go through
            in this section are slightly more involved than is typical when developing a greedy
            algorithm, they illustrate the relationship between greedy algorithms and dynamic
            programming.
