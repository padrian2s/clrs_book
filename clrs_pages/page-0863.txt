           f. Show how to determine a natural cubic spline that interpolates a set of n C 1
              points .xi ; yi / satisfying x0 < x1 <    < xn , even when xi is not necessarily
              equal to i. What matrix equation must your method solve, and how quickly
              does your algorithm run?


Chapter notes

           Many excellent texts describe numerical and scientiﬁc computation in much greater
           detail than we have room for here. The following are especially readable: George
           and Liu [132], Golub and Van Loan [144], Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling, and Flan-
           nery [283, 284], and Strang [323, 324].
              Golub and Van Loan [144] discuss numerical stability. They show why det.A/
           is not necessarily a good indicator of the stability ofPa matrix A, proposing instead
                                                                    n
           to use kAk1 kA1 k1 , where kAk1 D max1i n j D1 jaij j. They also address
           the question of how to compute this value without actually computing A1 .
              Gaussian elimination, upon which the LU and LUP decompositions are based,
           was the ﬁrst systematic method for solving linear systems of equations. It was also
           one of the earliest numerical algorithms. Although it was known earlier, its dis-
           covery is commonly attributed to C. F. Gauss (1777–1855). In his famous paper
           [325], Strassen showed that an n n matrix can be inverted in O.nlg 7 / time. Wino-
           grad [358] originally proved that matrix multiplication is no harder than matrix
           inversion, and the converse is due to Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman [5].
              Another important matrix decomposition is the singular value decomposition,
           or SVD. The SVD factors an m n matrix A into A D Q1 †Q2T , where † is an
           m n matrix with nonzero values only on the diagonal, Q1 is m m with mutually
           orthonormal columns, and Q2 is n n, also with mutually orthonormal columns.
           Two vectors are orthonormal if their inner product is 0 and each vector has a norm
           of 1. The books by Strang [323, 324] and Golub and Van Loan [144] contain good
           treatments of the SVD.
              Strang [324] has an excellent presentation of symmetric positive-deﬁnite matri-
           ces and of linear algebra in general.
