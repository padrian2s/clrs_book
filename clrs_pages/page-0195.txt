             Figure 7.3 The two cases for one iteration of procedure PARTITION. (a) If AŒj  > x, the only
             action is to increment j , which maintains the loop invariant. (b) If AŒj   x, index i is incremented,
             AŒi and AŒj  are swapped, and then j is incremented. Again, the loop invariant is maintained.


             7.1-2
             What value of q does PARTITION return when all elements in the array AŒp : : r
             have the same value? Modify PARTITION so that q D b.p C r/=2c when all
             elements in the array AŒp : : r have the same value.

             7.1-3
             Give a brief argument that the running time of PARTITION on a subarray of size n
             is ‚.n/.

             How would you modify Q UICKSORT to sort into nonincreasing order?



7.2   Performance of quicksort

             The running time of quicksort depends on whether the partitioning is balanced or
             unbalanced, which in turn depends on which elements are used for partitioning.
             If the partitioning is balanced, the algorithm runs asymptotically as fast as merge
