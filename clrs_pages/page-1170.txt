A.2 Bounding summations

          We have many techniques at our disposal for bounding the summations that de-
          scribe the running times of algorithms. Here are some of the most frequently used
          methods.

          Mathematical induction
          The most basic way to evaluate a series is to use
                                                          Pn mathematical induction. As an
          example, let us prove that the arithmetic series kD1 k evaluates to 12 n.n C 1/. We
          can easily verify this assertion for n D 1. We make the inductive assumption that
