110   Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer


      b. Consider the problem of ﬁnding a single good chip from among n chips, as-
         suming that more than n=2 of the chips are good. Show that bn=2c pairwise
         tests are sufﬁcient to reduce the problem to one of nearly half the size.

      c. Show that the good chips can be identiﬁed with ‚.n/ pairwise tests, assuming
         that more than n=2 of the chips are good. Give and solve the recurrence that
         describes the number of tests.

      4-6 Monge arrays
      An m n array A of real numbers is a Monge array if for all i, j , k, and l such
      that 1  i < k  m and 1  j < l  n, we have
      AŒi; j  C AŒk; l  AŒi; l C AŒk; j  :
      In other words, whenever we pick two rows and two columns of a Monge array and
      consider the four elements at the intersections of the rows and the columns, the sum
      of the upper-left and lower-right elements is less than or equal to the sum of the
      lower-left and upper-right elements. For example, the following array is Monge:
      10    17   13   28   23
      17    22   16   29   23
      24    28   22   34   24
      11    13    6   17    7
      45    44   32   37   23
      36    33   19   21    6
      75    66   51   53   34

      a. Prove that an array is Monge if and only if for all i D 1; 2; :::; m  1 and
         j D 1; 2; :::; n  1, we have

           AŒi; j  C AŒi C 1; j C 1  AŒi; j C 1 C AŒi C 1; j  :

           (Hint: For the “if” part, use induction separately on rows and columns.)

      b. The following array is not Monge. Change one element in order to make it
         Monge. (Hint: Use part (a).)
