B.1 Sets                                                                        1159


   If all the elements of a set A are contained in a set B, that is, if x 2 A implies
x 2 B, then we write A  B and say that A is a subset of B. A set A is a
proper subset of B, written A B, if A  B but A ¤ B. (Some authors use the
symbol “ ” to denote the ordinary subset relation, rather than the proper-subset
relation.) For any set A, we have A  A. For two sets A and B, we have A D B
if and only if A  B and B  A. For any three sets A, B, and C , if A  B
and B  C , then A  C . For any set A, we have ;  A.
   We sometimes deﬁne sets in terms of other sets. Given a set A, we can deﬁne a
set B  A by stating a property that distinguishes the elements of B. For example,
we can deﬁne the set of even integers by fx W x 2 Z and x=2 is an integerg. The
colon in this notation is read “such that.” (Some authors use a vertical bar in place
of the colon.)
   Given two sets A and B, we can also deﬁne new sets by applying set operations:
   The intersection of sets A and B is the set

    A \ B D fx W x 2 A and x 2 Bg :

   The union of sets A and B is the set

    A [ B D fx W x 2 A or x 2 Bg :

   The difference between two sets A and B is the set

    A  B D fx W x 2 A and x … Bg :

    Set operations obey the following laws:
Empty set laws:
    A\; D ;;
    A[; D A:

Idempotency laws:
    A\A D A;
    A[A D A:

Commutative laws:
    A\B D B \A;
    A[B D B [A:
