6.5   Priority queues

             Heapsort is an excellent algorithm, but a good implementation of quicksort, pre-
             sented in Chapter 7, usually beats it in practice. Nevertheless, the heap data struc-
             ture itself has many uses. In this section, we present one of the most popular ap-
             plications of a heap: as an efﬁcient priority queue. As with heaps, priority queues
             come in two forms: max-priority queues and min-priority queues. We will focus
             here on how to implement max-priority queues, which are in turn based on max-
             heaps; Exercise 6.5-3 asks you to write the procedures for min-priority queues.
                A priority queue is a data structure for maintaining a set S of elements, each
             with an associated value called a key. A max-priority queue supports the following
             operations:
             I NSERT .S; x/ inserts the element x into the set S, which is equivalent to the oper-
                ation S D S [ fxg.
             M AXIMUM .S/ returns the element of S with the largest key.
             E XTRACT-M AX .S/ removes and returns the element of S with the largest key.
             I NCREASE -K EY .S; x; k/ increases the value of element x’s key to the new value k,
                which is assumed to be at least as large as x’s current key value.
                Among their other applications, we can use max-priority queues to schedule
             jobs on a shared computer. The max-priority queue keeps track of the jobs to
             be performed and their relative priorities. When a job is ﬁnished or interrupted,
             the scheduler selects the highest-priority job from among those pending by calling
             E XTRACT-M AX. The scheduler can add a new job to the queue at any time by
             calling I NSERT.
                Alternatively, a min-priority queue supports the operations I NSERT, M INIMUM,
             E XTRACT-M IN, and D ECREASE -K EY. A min-priority queue can be used in an
             event-driven simulator. The items in the queue are events to be simulated, each
             with an associated time of occurrence that serves as its key. The events must be
             simulated in order of their time of occurrence, because the simulation of an event
             can cause other events to be simulated in the future. The simulation program calls
             E XTRACT-M IN at each step to choose the next event to simulate. As new events are
             produced, the simulator inserts them into the min-priority queue by calling I NSERT.
