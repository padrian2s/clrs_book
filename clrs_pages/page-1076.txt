Encodings
In order for a computer program to solve an abstract problem, we must represent
problem instances in a way that the program understands. An encoding of a set S
of abstract objects is a mapping e from S to the set of binary strings.2 For example,
we are all familiar with encoding the natural numbers N D f0; 1; 2; 3; 4; : : :g as
the strings f0; 1; 10; 11; 100; : : :g. Using this encoding, e.17/ D 10001. If you
have looked at computer representations of keyboard characters, you probably have
seen the ASCII code, where, for example, the encoding of A is 1000001. We can
encode a compound object as a binary string by combining the representations of
its constituent parts. Polygons, graphs, functions, ordered pairs, programs—all can
be encoded as binary strings.
   Thus, a computer algorithm that “solves” some abstract decision problem actu-
ally takes an encoding of a problem instance as input. We call a problem whose
instance set is the set of binary strings a concrete problem. We say that an algo-
rithm solves a concrete problem in time O.T .n// if, when it is provided a problem
instance i of length n D jij, the algorithm can produce the solution in O.T .n//
time.3 A concrete problem is polynomial-time solvable, therefore, if there exists
an algorithm to solve it in time O.nk / for some constant k.
   We can now formally deﬁne the complexity class P as the set of concrete deci-
sion problems that are polynomial-time solvable.
   We can use encodings to map abstract problems to concrete problems. Given
an abstract decision problem Q mapping an instance set I to f0; 1g, an encoding
e W I ! f0; 1g can induce a related concrete decision problem, which we denote
by e.Q/.4 If the solution to an abstract-problem instance i 2 I is Q.i/ 2 f0; 1g,
then the solution to the concrete-problem instance e.i/ 2 f0; 1g is also Q.i/. As a
technicality, some binary strings might represent no meaningful abstract-problem
instance. For convenience, we shall assume that any such string maps arbitrarily
to 0. Thus, the concrete problem produces the same solutions as the abstract prob-
lem on binary-string instances that represent the encodings of abstract-problem
instances.
   We would like to extend the deﬁnition of polynomial-time solvability from con-
crete problems to abstract problems by using encodings as the bridge, but we would


2 The codomain of e need not be binary strings; any set of strings over a ﬁnite alphabet having at

least 2 symbols will do.
3 We assume that the algorithm’s output is separate from its input. Because it takes at least one time

step to produce each bit of the output and the algorithm takes O.T .n// time steps, the size of the
output is O.T .n//.
4 We denote by f0; 1g the set of all strings composed of symbols from the set f0; 1g.
