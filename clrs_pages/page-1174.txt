Then for any constant k0 > 0, we can write

                                  kDk0

since the initial terms of the summation are all constant andPthere are a constant

number of them. We can then use other methods to bound kDk0 ak . This tech-
nique applies to inﬁnite summations as well. For example, to ﬁnd an asymptotic
upper bound on

we observe that the ratio of consecutive terms is

since the ﬁrst summation has a constant number of terms and the second summation
is a decreasing geometric series.
   The technique of splitting summations can help us determine asymptotic bounds
in much more difﬁcult situations. For example, we can obtain a bound of O.lg n/
on the harmonic series (A.7):
           X
           n
             1
Hn D                 :

           kD1

We do so by splitting the range 1 to n into blg nc C 1 pieces and upper-bounding
the contribution of each piece by 1. For i D 0; 1; : : : ; blg nc, the ith piece consists
