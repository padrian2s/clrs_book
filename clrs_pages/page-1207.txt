1186   Appendix C   Counting and Probability


       These numbers are also known as binomial coefﬁcients, due to their appearance in
       the binomial expansion:
                          !
                   Xn
                        n
       .x C y/n D           x k y nk :                                           (C.4)
                        k
                     kD0

       A special case of the binomial expansion occurs when x D y D 1:
                    !
            Xn
                  n
       2n D           :
                  k
             kD0

       This formula corresponds to counting the 2n binary n-strings by the number of 1s
       they contain: nk binary n-strings contain exactly k 1s, since we have nk ways to
       choose k out of the n positions in which to place the 1s.
          Many identities involve binomial coefﬁcients. The exercises at the end of this
       section give you the opportunity to prove a few.

       Binomial bounds
       We sometimes need to bound the size of a binomial coefﬁcient. For 1  k  n,
       we have the lower bound
          !
        n         n.n  1/    .n  k C 1/
             D
        k               k.k  1/    1
                  n n  1 n  k C 1
                       
             D                     
                    k    k1                1
                   n k
                        :
                    k
       Taking advantage of the inequality kŠ  .k=e/k derived from Stirling’s approxi-
       mation (3.18), we obtain the upper bounds
          !

                  k
       For all integers k such that 0  k  n, we can use induction (see Exercise C.1-12)
       to prove the bound
