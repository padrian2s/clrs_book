       of the terms starting at 1=2i and going up to but not including 1=2i C1 . The last
       piece might contain terms not in the original harmonic series, and thus we have

       Approximation by integrals

       When a summation has the form kDm f .k/, where f .k/ is a monotonically in-
       creasing function, we can approximate it by integrals:
       Z n               Xn         Z nC1
             f .x/ dx      f .k/        f .x/ dx :                       (A.11)
        m1                    kDm            m

       Figure A.1 justiﬁes this approximation. The summation is represented as the area
       of the rectangles in the ﬁgure, and the integral is the shaded region under the curve.
       When f .k/ is a monotonically decreasing function, we can use a similar method
       to provide the bounds
       Z nC1               Xn           Z n
              f .x/ dx        f .k/        f .x/ dx :                               (A.12)
        m                                     m1
                               kDm

          The integral approximation (A.12) gives a tight estimate for the nth harmonic
       number. For a lower bound, we obtain
       Xn           Z nC1
           1              dx
               

       For the upper bound, we derive the inequality
       Xn          Z n
           1           dx
