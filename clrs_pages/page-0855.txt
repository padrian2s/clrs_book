834   Chapter 28 Matrix Operations


         We now turn to some essential properties of the Schur complement. Let A be
      a symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrix, and let Ak be a leading k k submatrix
      of A. Partition A once again according to equation (28.14). We generalize equa-
      tion (28.9) to deﬁne the Schur complement S of A with respect to Ak as
      S D C  BA1 T
                k B :                                                                (28.15)
      (By Lemma 28.4, Ak is symmetric and positive-deﬁnite; therefore, A1 k exists by
      Lemma 28.3, and S is well deﬁned.) Note that our earlier deﬁnition (28.9) of the
      Schur complement is consistent with equation (28.15), by letting k D 1.
         The next lemma shows that the Schur-complement matrices of symmetric posi-
      tive-deﬁnite matrices are themselves symmetric and positive-deﬁnite. We used this
      result in Theorem 28.2, and we need its corollary to prove the correctness of LU
      decomposition for symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrices.

      Lemma 28.5 (Schur complement lemma)
      If A is a symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrix and Ak is a leading k k submatrix
      of A, then the Schur complement S of A with respect to Ak is symmetric and
      positive-deﬁnite.

      Proof Because A is symmetric, so is the submatrix C . By Exercise D.2-6, the
      product BA1       T
                   k B is symmetric, and by Exercise D.1-1, S is symmetric.
          It remains to show that S is positive-deﬁnite. Consider the partition of A given in
      equation (28.14). For any nonzero vector x, we have x T Ax > 0 by the assumption
      that A is positive-deﬁnite. Let us break x into two subvectors y and ´ compatible
      with Ak and C , respectively. Because A1   k exists, we have
                                                
        T               T   T     Ak B T        y
      x Ax D . y ´ /
                                  B C           ´
                                            T
                                                
                                  Ak y C B ´
                D . y T ´T /
                                   By C C ´
              D y T Ak y C y T B T ´ C ´T By C ´T C ´
              D .y C A1    T    T           1 T     T    1 T
                         k B ´/ Ak .y C Ak B ´/ C ´ .C  BAk B /´ ;                  (28.16)
      by matrix magic. (Verify by multiplying through.) This last equation amounts to
      “completing the square” of the quadratic form. (See Exercise 28.3-2.)
         Since x T Ax > 0 holds for any nonzero x, let us pick any nonzero ´ and then
      choose y D A1     T
                      k B ´, which causes the ﬁrst term in equation (28.16) to vanish,
      leaving
      ´T .C  BA1 T      T
                k B /´ D ´ S´

      as the value of the expression. For any ´ ¤ 0, we therefore have ´T S´ D
      x T Ax > 0, and thus S is positive-deﬁnite.
