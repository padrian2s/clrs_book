      Proof The proof relies on the existence of the inverse of a certain matrix. Equa-

      tion (30.3) is equivalent to the matrix equation

       The matrix on the left is denoted V .x0 ; x1 ; : : : ; xn1 / and is known as a Vander-
      monde matrix. By Problem D-1, this matrix has determinant
        Y
              .xk  xj / ;
      0j <kn1

      and therefore, by Theorem D.5, it is invertible (that is, nonsingular) if the xk are
      distinct. Thus, we can solve for the coefﬁcients aj uniquely given the point-value
      representation:
      a D V .x0 ; x1 ; : : : ; xn1 /1 y :
         The proof of Theorem 30.1 describes an algorithm for interpolation based on
      solving the set (30.4) of linear equations. Using the LU decomposition algorithms
      of Chapter 28, we can solve these equations in time O.n3 /.
         A faster algorithm for n-point interpolation is based on Lagrange’s formula:
                       Y
                            .x  xj /
               X
               n1
                       j ¤k
      A.x/ D        yk Y              :                                           (30.5)
               kD0         .xk  xj /
                         j ¤k

      You may wish to verify that the right-hand side of equation (30.5) is a polynomial
      of degree-bound n that satisﬁes A.xk / D yk for all k. Exercise 30.1-5 asks you
      how to compute the coefﬁcients of A using Lagrange’s formula in time ‚.n2 /.
         Thus, n-point evaluation and interpolation are well-deﬁned inverse operations
      that transform between the coefﬁcient representation of a polynomial and a point-
      value representation.1 The algorithms described above for these problems take
      time ‚.n2 /.
         The point-value representation is quite convenient for many operations on poly-
      nomials. For addition, if C.x/ D A.x/ C B.x/, then C.xk / D A.xk / C B.xk / for
      any point xk . More precisely, if we have a point-value representation for A,


      1 Interpolation is a notoriously tricky problem from the point of view of numerical stability. Although

      the approaches described here are mathematically correct, small differences in the inputs or round-off
      errors during computation can cause large differences in the result.
