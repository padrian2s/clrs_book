The n equations (28.18) for k D 1; 2; : : : ; n are equivalent to the single matrix
equation
.Ac  y/T A D 0
or, equivalently (using Exercise D.1-2), to
AT .Ac  y/ D 0 ;
which implies
AT Ac D AT y :                                                             (28.19)
In statistics, this is called the normal equation. The matrix AT A is symmetric
by Exercise D.1-2, and if A has full column rank, then by Theorem D.6, AT A
is positive-deﬁnite as well. Hence, .AT A/1 exists, and the solution to equa-
tion (28.19) is
c D          .AT A/1 AT y
    D AC y ;                                                               (28.20)
where the matrix AC D ..AT A/1 AT / is the pseudoinverse of the matrix A. The
pseudoinverse naturally generalizes the notion of a matrix inverse to the case in
which A is not square. (Compare equation (28.20) as the approximate solution to
Ac D y with the solution A1 b as the exact solution to Ax D b.)
  As an example of producing a least-squares ﬁt, suppose that we have ﬁve data
points
.x1 ; y1 /    D   .1; 2/ ;
.x2 ; y2 /    D   .1; 1/ ;
.x3 ; y3 /    D   .2; 1/ ;
.x4 ; y4 /    D   .3; 0/ ;
.x5 ; y5 /    D   .5; 3/ ;
shown as black dots in Figure 28.3. We wish to ﬁt these points with a quadratic
polynomial

We start with the matrix of basis-function values
