      since c.1 C b=.b  1//logb a is a constant. Thus, we have proved case 2. The proof
      of case 1 is almost identical. The key is to prove the bound f .nj / D O.nlogb a /,
      which is similar to the corresponding proof of case 2, though the algebra is more
      intricate.
         We have now proved the upper bounds in the master theorem for all integers n.
      The proof of the lower bounds is similar.

      Exercises

      4.6-1 ?
      Give a simple and exact expression for nj in equation (4.27) for the case in which b
      is a positive integer instead of an arbitrary real number.

      4.6-2 ?
      Show that if f .n/ D ‚.nlogb a lgk n/, where k  0, then the master recurrence has
      solution T .n/ D ‚.nlogb a lgkC1 n/. For simplicity, conﬁne your analysis to exact
      powers of b.

      4.6-3 ?
      Show that case 3 of the master theorem is overstated, in the sense that the regularity
      condition af .n=b/  cf .n/ for some constant c < 1 implies that there exists a
      constant  > 0 such that f .n/ D .nlogb aC /.
