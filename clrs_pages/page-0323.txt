302   Chapter 12 Binary Search Trees


         Using the substitution method, we shall show that for all positive integers n, the
      recurrence (12.2) has the solution
                         !
                1 nC3
      E ŒYn               :
                4    3
      In doing so, we shall use the identity
                 !            !
      X
      n1
            i C3        nC3
                    D            :                                                  (12.3)
      i D0
              3            4
      (Exercise 12.4-1 asks you to prove this identity.)
        For the base cases, we note that the bounds 0 D Y0 D E ŒY0   .1=4/ 33 D 1=4
      and 1 D Y1 D E ŒY1   .1=4/ 1C33
                                          D 1 hold. For the inductive case, we have that
                    4X
                      n1
      E ŒYn              E ŒYi 
                    n i D0
                                     !
                    4 X1 i C3
                      n1
                                        (by the inductive hypothesis)
                    n i D0 4   3
                                 !
                    1 X i C3
                      n1
                D
                    n i D0   3
                             !
                    1 nC3
                D                        (by equation (12.3))
                    n      4
                    1 .n C 3/Š

                    n 4Š .n  1/Š
                    1 .n C 3/Š

                    4   3Š nŠ!
                    1 nC3
                D              :
                    4   3
         We have bounded E ŒYn , but our ultimate goal is to bound E ŒXn . As Exer-
      cise 12.4-4 asks you to show, the function f .x/ D 2x is convex (see page 1199).
      Therefore, we can employ Jensen’s inequality (C.26), which says that
                        
      2EŒXn   E 2Xn
              D E ŒYn  ;
      as follows:
                              !
                    1 nC3
      2EŒXn    
