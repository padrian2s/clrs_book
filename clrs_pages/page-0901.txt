880   Chapter 29 Linear Programming


      whose optimal value is identical to that of the original linear program. When refer-
      ring to dual linear programs, we call the original linear program the primal.
         Given a primal linear program in standard form, as in (29.16)–(29.18), we deﬁne
      the dual linear program as
                    X
                    m
      minimize              bi y i                                                  (29.83)
                     i D1
      subject to
                   X
                   m
                           aij yi     cj   for j D 1; 2; : : : ; n ;               (29.84)
                    i D1
                               yi     0    for i D 1; 2; : : : ; m :               (29.85)
         To form the dual, we change the maximization to a minimization, exchange the
      roles of coefﬁcients on the right-hand sides and the objective function, and replace
      each less-than-or-equal-to by a greater-than-or-equal-to. Each of the m constraints
      in the primal has an associated variable yi in the dual, and each of the n constraints
      in the dual has an associated variable xj in the primal. For example, consider the
      linear program given in (29.53)–(29.57). The dual of this linear program is
      minimize     30y1 C 24y2              C 36y3                                  (29.86)
      subject to
                      y1 C 2y2              C    4y3          3                    (29.87)
                      y1 C 2y2              C     y3          1                    (29.88)
                     3y1 C 5y2              C    2y3          2                    (29.89)
                        y1 ; y2 ; y3                          0 :                  (29.90)
         We shall show in Theorem 29.10 that the optimal value of the dual linear pro-
      gram is always equal to the optimal value of the primal linear program. Further-
      more, the simplex algorithm actually implicitly solves both the primal and the dual
      linear programs simultaneously, thereby providing a proof of optimality.
         We begin by demonstrating weak duality, which states that any feasible solu-
      tion to the primal linear program has a value no greater than that of any feasible
      solution to the dual linear program.

      Lemma 29.8 (Weak linear-programming duality)
      Let xN be any feasible solution to the primal linear program in (29.16)–(29.18) and
      let yN be any feasible solution to the dual linear program in (29.83)–(29.85). Then,
      we have
      X n           X
                    m
           cj xNj     bi yNi :
      j D1         i D1
