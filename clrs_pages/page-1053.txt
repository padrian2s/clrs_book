               Figure 33.7 The execution of G RAHAM -S CAN on the set Q of Figure 33.6. The current convex
               hull contained in stack S is shown in gray at each step. (a) The sequence hp1 ; p2 ; : : : ; p12 i of points
               numbered in order of increasing polar angle relative to p0 , and the initial stack S containing p0 , p1 ,
               and p2 . (b)–(k) Stack S after each iteration of the for loop of lines 7–10. Dashed lines show nonleft
               turns, which cause points to be popped from the stack. In part (h), for example, the right turn at
               angle †p7 p8 p9 causes p8 to be popped, and then the right turn at angle †p6 p7 p9 causes p7 to be
               popped.
