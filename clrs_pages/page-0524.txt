Problems for Chapter 18                                                               503


   To implement the P USH operation, we increment the stack pointer, read the ap-
propriate page into memory from disk, copy the element to be pushed to the ap-
propriate word on the page, and write the page back to disk. A P OP operation is
similar. We decrement the stack pointer, read in the appropriate page from disk,
and return the top of the stack. We need not write back the page, since it was not
modiﬁed.
   Because disk operations are relatively expensive, we count two costs for any
implementation: the total number of disk accesses and the total CPU time. Any
disk access to a page of m words incurs charges of one disk access and ‚.m/ CPU
time.
a. Asymptotically, what is the worst-case number of disk accesses for n stack
   operations using this simple implementation? What is the CPU time for n stack
   operations? (Express your answer in terms of m and n for this and subsequent
   parts.)
Now consider a stack implementation in which we keep one page of the stack in
memory. (We also maintain a small amount of memory to keep track of which page
is currently in memory.) We can perform a stack operation only if the relevant disk
page resides in memory. If necessary, we can write the page currently in memory
to the disk and read in the new page from the disk to memory. If the relevant disk
page is already in memory, then no disk accesses are required.
b. What is the worst-case number of disk accesses required for n P USH opera-
   tions? What is the CPU time?

c. What is the worst-case number of disk accesses required for n stack operations?
   What is the CPU time?
Suppose that we now implement the stack by keeping two pages in memory (in
addition to a small number of words for bookkeeping).
d. Describe how to manage the stack pages so that the amortized number of disk
   accesses for any stack operation is O.1=m/ and the amortized CPU time for
   any stack operation is O.1/.


18-2 Joining and splitting 2-3-4 trees
The join operation takes two dynamic sets S 0 and S 00 and an element x such that
for any x 0 2 S 0 and x 00 2 S 00 , we have x 0 :key < x:key < x 00 :key. It returns a set
S D S 0 [ fxg [ S 00 . The split operation is like an “inverse” join: given a dynamic
set S and an element x 2 S, it creates a set S 0 that consists of all elements in
S  fxg whose keys are less than x:key and a set S 00 that consists of all elements
in S  fxg whose keys are greater than x:key. In this problem, we investigate
