Figure 16.3 A character-coding problem. A data ﬁle of 100,000 characters contains only the char-
acters a–f, with the frequencies indicated. If we assign each character a 3-bit codeword, we can
encode the ﬁle in 300,000 bits. Using the variable-length code shown, we can encode the ﬁle in only
224,000 bits.


in which each character is represented by a unique binary string, which we call a
codeword. If we use a ﬁxed-length code, we need 3 bits to represent 6 characters:
a = 000, b = 001, . . . , f = 101. This method requires 300,000 bits to code the
entire ﬁle. Can we do better?
   A variable-length code can do considerably better than a ﬁxed-length code, by
giving frequent characters short codewords and infrequent characters long code-
words. Figure 16.3 shows such a code; here the 1-bit string 0 represents a, and the
4-bit string 1100 represents f. This code requires

to represent the ﬁle, a savings of approximately 25%. In fact, this is an optimal
character code for this ﬁle, as we shall see.

Preﬁx codes
We consider here only codes in which no codeword is also a preﬁx of some other
codeword. Such codes are called preﬁx codes.3 Although we won’t prove it here, a
preﬁx code can always achieve the optimal data compression among any character
code, and so we suffer no loss of generality by restricting our attention to preﬁx
codes.
   Encoding is always simple for any binary character code; we just concatenate the
codewords representing each character of the ﬁle. For example, with the variable-
length preﬁx code of Figure 16.3, we code the 3-character ﬁle abc as 0101100 D
0101100, where “” denotes concatenation.
   Preﬁx codes are desirable because they simplify decoding. Since no codeword
is a preﬁx of any other, the codeword that begins an encoded ﬁle is unambiguous.
We can simply identify the initial codeword, translate it back to the original char-


3 Perhaps “preﬁx-free codes” would be a better name, but the term “preﬁx codes” is standard in the

literature.
