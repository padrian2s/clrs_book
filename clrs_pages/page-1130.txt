Figure 35.1 The operation of A PPROX -V ERTEX -C OVER. (a) The input graph G, which has 7
vertices and 8 edges. (b) The edge .b; c/, shown heavy, is the ﬁrst edge chosen by A PPROX -V ERTEX -
C OVER. Vertices b and c, shown lightly shaded, are added to the set C containing the vertex cover
being created. Edges .a; b/, .c; e/, and .c; d /, shown dashed, are removed since they are now covered
by some vertex in C . (c) Edge .e; f / is chosen; vertices e and f are added to C . (d) Edge .d; g/
is chosen; vertices d and g are added to C . (e) The set C , which is the vertex cover produced by
A PPROX -V ERTEX -C OVER, contains the six vertices b; c; d; e; f; g. (f) The optimal vertex cover for
this problem contains only three vertices: b, d , and e.

Figure 35.1 illustrates how A PPROX -V ERTEX -C OVER operates on an example
graph. The variable C contains the vertex cover being constructed. Line 1 ini-
tializes C to the empty set. Line 2 sets E 0 to be a copy of the edge set G:E of
the graph. The loop of lines 3–6 repeatedly picks an edge .u; / from E 0 , adds its
