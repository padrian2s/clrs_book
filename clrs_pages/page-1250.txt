           Notes for Appendix D                                                         1229

           we get the following permutation A;c : A;c .0/ D 2, A;c .1/ D 1, A;c .2/ D 0,
           A;c .3/ D 3. We call any permutation that maps x 2 Sn to Ax C c, for some n n
           0-1 matrix A with full rank and some n-bit vector c, a linear permutation.

           d. Use a counting argument to show that the number of linear permutations of Sn
              is much less than the number of permutations of Sn .

           e. Give an example of a value of n and a permutation of Sn that cannot be achieved
              by any linear permutation. (Hint: For a given permutation, think about how
              multiplying a matrix by a unit vector relates to the columns of the matrix.)


Appendix notes

           Linear-algebra textbooks provide plenty of background information on matrices.
           The books by Strang [323, 324] are particularly good.
