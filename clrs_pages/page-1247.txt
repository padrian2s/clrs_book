           D.2-3
           Prove that if P is a permutation matrix, then P is invertible, its inverse is P T ,
           and P T is a permutation matrix.

           D.2-4
           Let A and B be n n matrices such that AB D I . Prove that if A0 is obtained
           from A by adding row j into row i, then subtracting column i from column j of B
           yields the inverse B 0 of A0 .

           D.2-5
           Let A be a nonsingular n n matrix with complex entries. Show that every entry
           of A1 is real if and only if every entry of A is real.

           D.2-6
           Show that if A is a nonsingular, symmetric, n n matrix, then A1 is symmetric.
           Show that if B is an arbitrary m n matrix, then the m m matrix given by the
           product BAB T is symmetric.

           D.2-7
           Prove Theorem D.2. That is, show that a matrix A has full column rank if and only
           if Ax D 0 implies x D 0. (Hint: Express the linear dependence of one column on
           the others as a matrix-vector equation.)

           D.2-8
           Prove that for any two compatible matrices A and B,
           rank.AB/  min.rank.A/; rank.B// ;
           where equality holds if either A or B is a nonsingular square matrix. (Hint: Use
           the alternate deﬁnition of the rank of a matrix.)
