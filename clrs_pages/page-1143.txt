1122   Chapter 35 Approximation Algorithms


       Corollary 35.5
       G REEDY-S ET-C OVER is a polynomial-time .ln jX j C 1/-approximation algorithm.

       Proof   Use inequality (A.14) and Theorem 35.4.

          In some applications, max fjSj W S 2 F g is a small constant, and so the solution
       returned by G REEDY-S ET-C OVER is at most a small constant times larger than
       optimal. One such application occurs when this heuristic ﬁnds an approximate
       vertex cover for a graph whose vertices have degree at most 3. In this case, the
       solution found by G REEDY-S ET-C OVER is not more than H.3/ D 11=6 times as
       large as an optimal solution, a performance guarantee that is slightly better than
       that of A PPROX -V ERTEX -C OVER.

       Exercises

       35.3-1
       Consider each of the following words as a set of letters: farid; dash; drain;
       heard; lost; nose; shun; slate; snare; threadg. Show which set cover
       G REEDY-S ET-C OVER produces when we break ties in favor of the word that ap-
       pears ﬁrst in the dictionary.

       35.3-2
       Show that the decision version of the set-covering problem is NP-complete by
       reducing it from the vertex-cover problem.

       35.3-5
       G REEDY-S ET-C OVER can return a number of different solutions, depending on
       how we break ties in line 4. Give a procedure BAD -S ET-C OVER -I NSTANCE .n/
       that returns an n-element instance of the set-covering problem for which, depend-
       ing on how we break ties in line 4, G REEDY-S ET-C OVER can return a number of
       different solutions that is exponential in n.
