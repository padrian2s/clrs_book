is bounded from above by the constant 16=13. Since the root’s contribution to the
total cost is cn2 , the root contributes a constant fraction of the total cost. In other
words, the cost of the root dominates the total cost of the tree.
   In fact, if O.n2 / is indeed an upper bound for the recurrence (as we shall verify in
a moment), then it must be a tight bound. Why? The ﬁrst recursive call contributes
a cost of ‚.n2 /, and so .n2 / must be a lower bound for the recurrence.
   Now we can use the substitution method to verify that our guess was cor-
rect, that is, T .n/ D O.n2 / is an upper bound for the recurrence T .n/ D
3T .bn=4c/ C ‚.n2 /. We want to show that T .n/  d n2 for some constant d > 0.
Using the same constant c > 0 as before, we have
T .n/  3T .bn=4c/ C cn2
       3d bn=4c2 C cn2
       3d.n=4/2 C cn2
         3
      D    d n2 C cn2
        16
       d n2 ;
where the last step holds as long as d  .16=13/c.
  In another, more intricate, example, Figure 4.6 shows the recursion tree for
T .n/ D T .n=3/ C T .2n=3/ C O.n/ :
(Again, we omit ﬂoor and ceiling functions for simplicity.) As before, we let c
represent the constant factor in the O.n/ term. When we add the values across the
levels of the recursion tree shown in the ﬁgure, we get a value of cn for every level.
