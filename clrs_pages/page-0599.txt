      Proof If x is a root or x:rank D 0, then q .x/ D ˛.n/x:rank by deﬁnition. Now
      suppose that x is not a root and that x:rank  1. We obtain a lower bound on q .x/
      by maximizing level.x/ and iter.x/. By the bound (21.1), level.x/  ˛.n/  1, and
      by the bound (21.2), iter.x/  x:rank. Thus,
      q .x/ D      .˛.n/  level.x//  x:rank  iter.x/
                   .˛.n/  .˛.n/  1//  x:rank  x:rank
             D      x:rank  x:rank
             D      0:
      Similarly, we obtain an upper bound on q .x/ by minimizing level.x/ and iter.x/.
      By the bound (21.1), level.x/  0, and by the bound (21.2), iter.x/  1. Thus,
      q .x/  .˛.n/  0/  x:rank  1
             D ˛.n/  x:rank  1
             < ˛.n/  x:rank :

      Corollary 21.9
      If node x is not a root and x:rank > 0, then q .x/ < ˛.n/  x:rank.


      Potential changes and amortized costs of operations
      We are now ready to examine how the disjoint-set operations affect node potentials.
      With an understanding of the change in potential due to each operation, we can
      determine each operation’s amortized cost.

      Lemma 21.10
      Let x be a node that is not a root, and suppose that the qth operation is either a
      L INK or F IND -S ET. Then after the qth operation, q .x/  q1 .x/. Moreover, if
      x:rank  1 and either level.x/ or iter.x/ changes due to the qth operation, then
      q .x/  q1 .x/  1. That is, x’s potential cannot increase, and if it has positive
      rank and either level.x/ or iter.x/ changes, then x’s potential drops by at least 1.

      Proof Because x is not a root, the qth operation does not change x:rank, and
      because n does not change after the initial n M AKE -S ET operations, ˛.n/ remains
      unchanged as well. Hence, these components of the formula for x’s potential re-
      main the same after the qth operation. If x:rank D 0, then q .x/ D q1 .x/ D 0.
      Now assume that x:rank  1.
         Recall that level.x/ monotonically increases over time. If the qth operation
      leaves level.x/ unchanged, then iter.x/ either increases or remains unchanged.
      If both level.x/ and iter.x/ are unchanged, then q .x/ D q1 .x/. If level.x/
