Combining inequalities (35.28) and (35.30) completes the analysis of the approxi-
mation ratio.
   To show that A PPROX -S UBSET-S UM is a fully polynomial-time approximation
scheme, we derive a bound on the length of Li . After trimming, successive ele-
ments ´ and ´0 of Li must have the relationship ´0 =´ > 1C=2n. That is, they must
differ by a factor of at least 1 C =2n. Each˘list, therefore, contains the value 0,
possibly the value 1, and up to log1C=2n t additional values. The number of
elements in each list Li is at most
                            ln t
log1C=2n t C 2 D                   C2

                                        C 2 (by inequality (3.17))
                                 
                       3n ln t
                  <            C2            (by inequality (35.25)) .
                          
This bound is polynomial in the size of the input—which is the number of bits lg t
needed to represent t plus the number of bits needed to represent the set S, which is
in turn polynomial in n—and in 1=. Since the running time of A PPROX -S UBSET-
S UM is polynomial in the lengths of the Li , we conclude that A PPROX -S UBSET-
S UM is a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme.
