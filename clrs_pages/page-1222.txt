            Let X be a nonnegative random variable, and suppose that E ŒX  is well deﬁned.
            Prove Markov’s inequality:
            Pr fX  tg  E ŒX  =t                                                       (C.30)

            C.3-7 ?
            Let S be a sample space, and let X and X 0 be random variables such that
            X.s/  X 0 .s/ for all s 2 S. Prove that for any real constant t,

            Which is larger: the expectation of the square of a random variable, or the square
            of its expectation?

            C.3-9
            Show that for any random variable X that takes on only the values 0 and 1, we have
            Var ŒX  D E ŒX  E Œ1  X .

            C.3-10
            Prove that Var ŒaX  D a2 Var ŒX  from the deﬁnition (C.27) of variance.



C.4 The geometric and binomial distributions

            We can think of a coin ﬂip as an instance of a Bernoulli trial, which is an experi-
            ment with only two possible outcomes: success, which occurs with probability p,
            and failure, which occurs with probability q D 1p. When we speak of Bernoulli
            trials collectively, we mean that the trials are mutually independent and, unless we
            speciﬁcally say otherwise, that each has the same probability p for success. Two
