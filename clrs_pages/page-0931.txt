910   Chapter 30 Polynomials and the FFT


      for dealing with non-power-of-2 sizes are known, they are beyond the scope of this
      book.
         The FFT method employs a divide-and-conquer strategy, using the even-indexed
      and odd-indexed coefﬁcients of A.x/ separately to deﬁne the two new polynomials
      AŒ0 .x/ and AŒ1 .x/ of degree-bound n=2:
      AŒ0 .x/ D a0 C a2 x C a4 x 2 C    C an2 x n=21 ;
      AŒ1 .x/ D a1 C a3 x C a5 x 2 C    C an1 x n=21 :
      Note that AŒ0 contains all the even-indexed coefﬁcients of A (the binary represen-
      tation of the index ends in 0) and AŒ1 contains all the odd-indexed coefﬁcients (the
      binary representation of the index ends in 1). It follows that
      A.x/ D AŒ0 .x 2 / C xAŒ1 .x 2 / ;                                               (30.9)
      so that the problem of evaluating A.x/ at !n0 ; !n1 ; : : : ; !nn1 reduces to
      1. evaluating the degree-bound n=2 polynomials AŒ0 .x/ and AŒ1 .x/ at the points

         .!n0 /2 ; .!n1 /2 ; : : : ; .!nn1 /2 ;                                       (30.10)

         and then
      2. combining the results according to equation (30.9).
         By the halving lemma, the list of values (30.10) consists not of n distinct val-
      ues but only of the n=2 complex .n=2/th roots of unity, with each root occurring
      exactly twice. Therefore, we recursively evaluate the polynomials AŒ0 and AŒ1
      of degree-bound n=2 at the n=2 complex .n=2/th roots of unity. These subprob-
      lems have exactly the same form as the original problem, but are half the size.
      We have now successfully divided an n-element DFTn computation into two n=2-
      element DFTn=2 computations. This decomposition is the basis for the follow-
      ing recursive FFT algorithm, which computes the DFT of an n-element vector
      a D .a0 ; a1 ; : : : ; an1 /, where n is a power of 2.
