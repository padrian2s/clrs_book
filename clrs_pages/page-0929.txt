      Corollary 30.4
      For any even integer n > 0,
      !nn=2 D !2 D 1 :


      Proof        The proof is left as Exercise 30.2-1.


      Lemma 30.5 (Halving lemma)
      If n > 0 is even, then the squares of the n complex nth roots of unity are the n=2
      complex .n=2/th roots of unity.
                                                              k
      Proof By the cancellation lemma, we have .!nk /2 D !n=2    , for any nonnegative
      integer k. Note that if we square all of the complex nth roots of unity, then we
      obtain each .n=2/th root of unity exactly twice, since
      .!nkCn=2 /2 D          !n2kCn
                  D          !n2k !nn
                  D          !n2k
                  D          .!nk /2 :
      Thus, !nk and !nkCn=2 have the same square. We could also have used Corol-
      lary 30.4 to prove this property, since !nn=2 D 1 implies !nkCn=2 D !nk , and
      thus .!nkCn=2 /2 D .!nk /2 .

        As we shall see, the halving lemma is essential to our divide-and-conquer ap-
      proach for converting between coefﬁcient and point-value representations of poly-
      nomials, since it guarantees that the recursive subproblems are only half as large.

      Lemma 30.6 (Summation lemma)
      For any integer n  1 and nonzero integer k not divisible by n,
      X
      n1
                   j
             !nk       D0:
      j D0



      Proof        Equation (A.5) applies to complex values as well as to reals, and so we
      have
