           23-4 Alternative minimum-spanning-tree algorithms
           In this problem, we give pseudocode for three different algorithms. Each one takes
           a connected graph and a weight function as input and returns a set of edges T . For
           each algorithm, either prove that T is a minimum spanning tree or prove that T is
           not a minimum spanning tree. Also describe the most efﬁcient implementation of
           each algorithm, whether or not it computes a minimum spanning tree.

Chapter notes

           Tarjan [330] surveys the minimum-spanning-tree problem and provides excellent
           advanced material. Graham and Hell [151] compiled a history of the minimum-
           spanning-tree problem.
             Tarjan attributes the ﬁrst minimum-spanning-tree algorithm to a 1926 paper by
           O. Boru̇vka. Boru̇vka’s algorithm consists of running O.lg V / iterations of the
