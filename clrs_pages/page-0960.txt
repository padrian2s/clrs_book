           Prove that n1 , n2 , n3 , and n4 are pairwise relatively prime if and only if

31.3 Modular arithmetic

           Informally, we can think of modular arithmetic as arithmetic as usual over the
           integers, except that if we are working modulo n, then every result x is replaced
           by the element of f0; 1; : : : ; n  1g that is equivalent to x, modulo n (that is, x is
           replaced by x mod n). This informal model sufﬁces if we stick to the operations
           of addition, subtraction, and multiplication. A more formal model for modular
           arithmetic, which we now give, is best described within the framework of group
           theory.

           Finite groups
           A group .S; ˚/ is a set S together with a binary operation ˚ deﬁned on S for
           which the following properties hold:
           1. Closure: For all a, b 2 S, we have a ˚ b 2 S.
           2. Identity: There exists an element e 2 S, called the identity of the group, such
              that e ˚ a D a ˚ e D a for all a 2 S.
           3. Associativity: For all a, b, c 2 S, we have .a ˚ b/ ˚ c D a ˚ .b ˚ c/.
