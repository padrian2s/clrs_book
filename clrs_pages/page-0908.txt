Then L is feasible if and only if the optimal objective value of Laux is 0.

Proof Suppose that L has a feasible solution xN D .xN 1 ; xN 2 ; : : : ; xN n /. Then the
solution xN 0 D 0 combined with xN is a feasible solution to Laux with objective
value 0. Since x0  0 is a constraint of Laux and the objective function is to
maximize x0 , this solution must be optimal for Laux .
  Conversely, suppose that the optimal objective value of Laux is 0. Then xN 0 D 0,
and the remaining solution values of xN satisfy the constraints of L.

  We now describe our strategy to ﬁnd an initial basic feasible solution for a linear
program L in standard form:

I NITIALIZE -S IMPLEX .A; b; c/
  1 let k be the index of the minimum bi
  2 if bk  0                        // is the initial basic solution feasible?
  3      return .f1; 2; : : : ; ng ; fn C 1; n C 2; : : : ; n C mg ; A; b; c; 0/
  4 form Laux by adding x0 to the left-hand side of each constraint
         and setting the objective function to x0
  5 let .N; B; A; b; c; / be the resulting slack form for Laux
  6 l D nCk
  7 // Laux has n C 1 nonbasic variables and m basic variables.
  8 .N; B; A; b; c; / D P IVOT .N; B; A; b; c; ; l; 0/
  9 // The basic solution is now feasible for Laux .
10 iterate the while loop of lines 3–12 of S IMPLEX until an optimal solution
         to Laux is found
11 if the optimal solution to Laux sets xN 0 to 0
12       if xN 0 is basic
13              perform one (degenerate) pivot to make it nonbasic
14       from the ﬁnal slack form of Laux , remove x0 from the constraints and
                restore the original objective function of L, but replace each basic
                variable in this objective function by the right-hand side of its
                associated constraint
15       return the modiﬁed ﬁnal slack form
16 else return “infeasible”
