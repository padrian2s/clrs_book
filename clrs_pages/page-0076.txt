3.2 Standard notations and common functions                                      55


Polynomials
Given a nonnegative integer d , a polynomial in n of degree d is a function p.n/
of the form
         X
         d
p.n/ D          a i ni ;
         i D0

where the constants a0 ; a1 ; : : : ; ad are the coefﬁcients of the polynomial and
ad ¤ 0. A polynomial is asymptotically positive if and only if ad > 0. For an
asymptotically positive polynomial p.n/ of degree d , we have p.n/ D ‚.nd /. For
any real constant a  0, the function na is monotonically increasing, and for any
real constant a  0, the function na is monotonically decreasing. We say that a
function f .n/ is polynomially bounded if f .n/ D O.nk / for some constant k.

Exponentials
For all real a > 0, m, and n, we have the following identities:
   a0    D      1;
   a1    D      a;
  a1    D      1=a ;
.am /n   D      amn ;
.am /n   D      .an /m ;
am an    D      amCn :
For all n and a  1, the function an is monotonically increasing in n. When
convenient, we shall assume 00 D 1.
  We can relate the rates of growth of polynomials and exponentials by the fol-
lowing fact. For all real constants a and b such that a > 1,
     nb
lim     D0;                                                                  (3.10)
n!1 a n

from which we can conclude that
nb D o.an / :
Thus, any exponential function with a base strictly greater than 1 grows faster than
any polynomial function.
   Using e to denote 2:71828 : : :, the base of the natural logarithm function, we
have for all real x,
