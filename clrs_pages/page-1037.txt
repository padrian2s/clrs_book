       contains vectors that are counterclockwise from p.


       Cross products
       Computing cross products lies at the heart of our line-segment methods. Consider
       vectors p1 and p2 , shown in Figure 33.1(a). We can interpret the cross product
       p1 p2 as the signed area of the parallelogram formed by the points .0; 0/, p1 , p2 ,
       and p1 C p2 D .x1 C x2 ; y1 C y2 /. An equivalent, but more useful, deﬁnition gives
       the cross product as the determinant of a matrix:1
                                   
                            x1 x2
       p1 p2 D det
                            y1 y2
                  D x1 y 2  x2 y 1
                  D p2 p1 :
       If p1 p2 is positive, then p1 is clockwise from p2 with respect to the origin .0; 0/;
       if this cross product is negative, then p1 is counterclockwise from p2 . (See Exer-
       cise 33.1-1.) Figure 33.1(b) shows the clockwise and counterclockwise regions
       relative to a vector p. A boundary condition arises if the cross product is 0; in this
       case, the vectors are colinear, pointing in either the same or opposite directions.
          To determine whether a directed segment       p0p
                                                             ! is closer to a directed seg-
                                                               1
              !
       ment p0 p2 in a clockwise direction or in a counterclockwise direction with respect
       to their common endpoint p0 , we simply translate to use p0 as the origin. That
       is, we let p1  p0 denote the vector p10 D .x10 ; y10 /, where x10 D x1  x0 and
       y10 D y1  y0 , and we deﬁne p2  p0 similarly. We then compute the cross product


       1 Actually, the cross product is a three-dimensional concept. It is a vector that is perpendicular to

       both p1 and p2 according to the “right-hand rule” and whose magnitude is jx1 y2  x2 y1 j. In this
       chapter, however, we ﬁnd it convenient to treat the cross product simply as the value x1 y2  x2 y1 .
