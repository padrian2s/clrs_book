20.2 A recursive structure                                                        541


the summary structures altogether. The following procedure takes a proto-EB
structure V and a value x, and it returns a bit indicating whether x is in the dynamic
set held by V .

P ROTO - V EB-M EMBER .V; x/
1 if V:u == 2
2        return V:AŒx
3 else return P ROTO - V EB-M EMBER .V:clusterŒhigh.x/; low.x//

   The P ROTO - V EB-M EMBER procedure works as follows. Line 1 tests whether
we are in a base case, where V is a proto-EB.2/ structure. Line 2 handles the
base case, simply returning the appropriate bit of array A. Line 3 deals with the
recursive case, “drilling down” into the appropriate
                                            p           smaller proto-vEB structure.
The value high.x/ says which proto-EB. u/ p      structure we visit, and low.x/ de-
termines which element within that proto-EB. u/ structure we are querying.
   Let’s see what happens when we call P ROTO - V EB-M EMBER .V; 6/ on the
proto-EB.16/ structure in Figure 20.4. Since high.6/ D 1 when u D 16, we
recurse into the proto-EB.4/ structure in the upper right, and we ask about ele-
ment low.6/ D 2 of that structure. In this recursive call, u D 4, and so we recurse
again. With u D 4, we have high.2/ D 1 and low.2/ D 0, and so we ask about
element 0 of the proto-EB.2/ structure in the upper right. This recursive call turns
out to be a base case, and so it returns AŒ0 D 0 back up through the chain of re-
cursive calls. Thus, we get the result that P ROTO - V EB-M EMBER .V; 6/ returns 0,
indicating that 6 is not in the set.
   To determine the running time of P ROTO - V EB-M EMBER, let T .u/ denote
its running time on a proto-EB.u/ structure. Each recursive call takes con-
stant time, not including the time taken by the recursive calls that it makes.
When P ROTO  p - V EB-M EMBER makes a recursive call, it makes a call on a
proto-EB. u/ structure.
                    p        Thus, we can characterize the running time by the recur-
rence T .u/ D T . u/ C O.1/, which we have already seen as recurrence (20.2).
Its solution is T .u/ D O.lg lg u/, and so we conclude that P ROTO - V EB-M EMBER
runs in time O.lg lg u/.

Finding the minimum element
Now we examine how to perform the M INIMUM operation. The procedure
P ROTO - V EB-M INIMUM .V / returns the minimum element in the proto-vEB struc-
ture V , or NIL if V represents an empty set.
