558   Chapter 20 van Emde Boas Trees


      c. Modify the V EB-T REE -I NSERT procedure to produce pseudocode for the pro-
         cedure RS- V EB-T REE -I NSERT .V; x/, which inserts x into the RS-vEB tree V ,
         calling C REATE -N EW-RS- V EB-T REE as appropriate.

      d. Modify the V EB-T REE -S UCCESSOR procedure to produce pseudocode for
         the procedure RS- V EB-T REE -S UCCESSOR .V; x/, which returns the successor
         of x in RS-vEB tree V , or NIL if x has no successor in V .

      e. Prove that, under the assumption of simple uniform hashing, your RS- V EB-
         T REE -I NSERT and RS- V EB-T REE -S UCCESSOR procedures run in O.lg lg u/
         expected time.

      f. Assuming that elements are never deleted from a vEB tree, prove that the space
         requirement for the RS-vEB tree structure is O.n/, where n is the number of
         elements actually stored in the RS-vEB tree.

      g. RS-vEB trees have another advantage over vEB trees: they require less time to
         create. How long does it take to create an empty RS-vEB tree?

      20-2 y-fast tries
      This problem investigates D. Willard’s “y-fast tries” which, like van Emde Boas
      trees, perform each of the operations M EMBER, M INIMUM, M AXIMUM, P RE -
      DECESSOR , and S UCCESSOR on elements drawn from a universe with size u in
      O.lg lg u/ worst-case time. The I NSERT and D ELETE operations take O.lg lg u/
      amortized time. Like reduced-space van Emde Boas trees (see Problem 20-1), y-
      fast tries use only O.n/ space to store n elements. The design of y-fast tries relies
      on perfect hashing (see Section 11.5).
         As a preliminary structure, suppose that we create a perfect hash table containing
      not only every element in the dynamic set, but every preﬁx of the binary represen-
      tation of every element in the set. For example, if u D 16, so that lg u D 4, and
      x D 13 is in the set, then because the binary representation of 13 is 1101, the
      perfect hash table would contain the strings 1, 11, 110, and 1101. In addition to
      the hash table, we create a doubly linked list of the elements currently in the set, in
      increasing order.
      a. How much space does this structure require?

      b. Show how to perform the M INIMUM and M AXIMUM operations in O.1/ time;
         the M EMBER, P REDECESSOR, and S UCCESSOR operations in O.lg lg u/ time;
         and the I NSERT and D ELETE operations in O.lg u/ time.
      To reduce the space requirement to O.n/, we make the following changes to the
      data structure:
