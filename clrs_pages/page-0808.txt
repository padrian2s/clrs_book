seems to ignore the overhead for recursive spawning in implementing the parallel
loops, however. In fact, the overhead of recursive spawning does increase the work
of a parallel loop compared with that of its serialization, but not asymptotically.
To see why, observe that since the tree of recursive procedure instances is a full
binary tree, the number of internal nodes is 1 fewer than the number of leaves (see
Exercise B.5-3). Each internal node performs constant work to divide the iteration
range, and each leaf corresponds to an iteration of the loop, which takes at least
constant time (‚.n/ time in this case). Thus, we can amortize the overhead of re-
cursive spawning against the work of the iterations, contributing at most a constant
factor to the overall work.
   As a practical matter, dynamic-multithreading concurrency platforms sometimes
coarsen the leaves of the recursion by executing several iterations in a single leaf,
either automatically or under programmer control, thereby reducing the overhead
of recursive spawning. This reduced overhead comes at the expense of also reduc-
ing the parallelism, however, but if the computation has sufﬁcient parallel slack-
ness, near-perfect linear speedup need not be sacriﬁced.
   We must also account for the overhead of recursive spawning when analyzing the
span of a parallel-loop construct. Since the depth of recursive calling is logarithmic
in the number of iterations, for a parallel loop with n iterations in which the ith
iteration has span iter1 .i/, the span is
T1 .n/ D ‚.lg n/ C max iter1 .i/ :
                       1i n

For example, for M AT-V EC on an n n matrix, the parallel initialization loop in
lines 3–4 has span ‚.lg n/, because the recursive spawning dominates the constant-
time work of each iteration. The span of the doubly nested loops in lines 5–7
is ‚.n/, because each iteration of the outer parallel for loop contains n iterations
of the inner (serial) for loop. The span of the remaining code in the procedure
is constant, and thus the span is dominated by the doubly nested loops, yielding
an overall span of ‚.n/ for the whole procedure. Since the work is ‚.n2 /, the
parallelism is ‚.n2 /=‚.n/ D ‚.n/. (Exercise 27.1-6 asks you to provide an
implementation with even more parallelism.)

Race conditions
A multithreaded algorithm is deterministic if it always does the same thing on the
same input, no matter how the instructions are scheduled on the multicore com-
puter. It is nondeterministic if its behavior might vary from run to run. Often, a
multithreaded algorithm that is intended to be deterministic fails to be, because it
contains a “determinacy race.”
  Race conditions are the bane of concurrency. Famous race bugs include the
Therac-25 radiation therapy machine, which killed three people and injured sev-
