       Figure 34.4 An illustration of a polynomial-time reduction from a language L1 to a language L2
       via a reduction function f . For any input x 2 f0; 1g , the question of whether x 2 L1 has the same
       answer as the question of whether f .x/ 2 L2 .


       then f .x/ 2 L2 . Moreover, if x 62 L1 , then f .x/ 62 L2 . Thus, the reduction func-
       tion maps any instance x of the decision problem represented by the language L1
       to an instance f .x/ of the problem represented by L2 . Providing an answer to
       whether f .x/ 2 L2 directly provides the answer to whether x 2 L1 .
          Polynomial-time reductions give us a powerful tool for proving that various lan-
       guages belong to P.

       Lemma 34.3
       If L1 ; L2  f0; 1g are languages such that L1 P L2 , then L2 2 P implies
       L1 2 P.

       Proof Let A2 be a polynomial-time algorithm that decides L2 , and let F be a
       polynomial-time reduction algorithm that computes the reduction function f . We
       shall construct a polynomial-time algorithm A1 that decides L1 .
          Figure 34.5 illustrates how we construct A1 . For a given input x 2 f0; 1g ,
       algorithm A1 uses F to transform x into f .x/, and then it uses A2 to test whether
       f .x/ 2 L2 . Algorithm A1 takes the output from algorithm A2 and produces that
       answer as its own output.
          The correctness of A1 follows from condition (34.1). The algorithm runs in poly-
       nomial time, since both F and A2 run in polynomial time (see Exercise 34.1-5).

       NP-completeness
       Polynomial-time reductions provide a formal means for showing that one prob-
       lem is at least as hard as another, to within a polynomial-time factor. That is, if
       L1 P L2 , then L1 is not more than a polynomial factor harder than L2 , which is
