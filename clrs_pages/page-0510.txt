18.1 Deﬁnition of B-trees                                                                  489


3. The keys x:keyi separate the ranges of keys stored in each subtree: if ki is any
   key stored in the subtree with root x:ci , then

    k1  x:key1  k2  x:key2      x:keyx: n  kx: nC1 :

4. All leaves have the same depth, which is the tree’s height h.
5. Nodes have lower and upper bounds on the number of keys they can contain.
   We express these bounds in terms of a ﬁxed integer t  2 called the minimum
   degree of the B-tree:
    a. Every node other than the root must have at least t  1 keys. Every internal
       node other than the root thus has at least t children. If the tree is nonempty,
       the root must have at least one key.
    b. Every node may contain at most 2t  1 keys. Therefore, an internal node
       may have at most 2t children. We say that a node is full if it contains exactly
       2t  1 keys.2
   The simplest B-tree occurs when t D 2. Every internal node then has either 2,
3, or 4 children, and we have a 2-3-4 tree. In practice, however, much larger values
of t yield B-trees with smaller height.

The height of a B-tree
The number of disk accesses required for most operations on a B-tree is propor-
tional to the height of the B-tree. We now analyze the worst-case height of a B-tree.

Theorem 18.1
If n  1, then for any n-key B-tree T of height h and minimum degree t  2,
            nC1
h  log t       :
             2

Proof The root of a B-tree T contains at least one key, and all other nodes contain
at least t  1 keys. Thus, T , whose height is h, has at least 2 nodes at depth 1, at
least 2t nodes at depth 2, at least 2t 2 nodes at depth 3, and so on, until at depth h
it has at least 2t h1 nodes. Figure 18.4 illustrates such a tree for h D 3. Thus, the


2 Another common variant on a B-tree, known as a B -tree, requires each internal node to be at

least 2=3 full, rather than at least half full, as a B-tree requires.
