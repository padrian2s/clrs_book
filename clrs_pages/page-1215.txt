       Bayes’s theorem
       From the deﬁnition of conditional probability (C.14) and the commutative law
       A \ B D B \ A, it follows that for two events A and B, each with nonzero
       probability,
       Pr fA \ Bg D Pr fBg Pr fA j Bg                                             (C.16)
                  D Pr fAg Pr fB j Ag :
       Solving for Pr fA j Bg, we obtain
                     Pr fAg Pr fB j Ag
       Pr fA j Bg D                    ;                                    (C.17)
                           Pr fBg
       which is known as Bayes’s theorem. The denominator Pr fBg is a normalizing
       constant, which we can reformulate as follows. Since B D .B \ A/ [ .B \ A/,
       and since B \ A and B \ A are mutually exclusive events,
                                     ˚
       Pr fBg D Pr fB \ Ag C Pr B \ A
                                          ˚       ˚
                D Pr fAg Pr fB j Ag C Pr A Pr B j A :
       Substituting into equation (C.17), we obtain an equivalent form of Bayes’s theo-
       rem:
                                   Pr fAg Pr fB j Ag
       Pr fA j Bg D                             ˚     ˚        :                   (C.18)
                      Pr fAg Pr fB j Ag C Pr A Pr B j A
          Bayes’s theorem can simplify the computing of conditional probabilities. For
       example, suppose that we have a fair coin and a biased coin that always comes up
       heads. We run an experiment consisting of three independent events: we choose
       one of the two coins at random, we ﬂip that coin once, and then we ﬂip it again.
       Suppose that the coin we have chosen comes up heads both times. What is the
       probability that it is biased?
          We solve this problem using Bayes’s theorem. Let A be the event that we choose
       the biased coin, and let B be the event that the chosen coin comes up heads both
       times.
          ˚ We wish to determine˚       Pr fA j Bg. We have Pr fAg D 1=2, Pr fB j Ag D 1,
       Pr A D 1=2, and Pr B j A D 1=4; hence,
                                .1=2/  1
       Pr fA j Bg D
                       .1=2/  1 C .1=2/  .1=4/
                     D 4=5 :

       Exercises

       C.2-1
       Professor Rosencrantz ﬂips a fair coin once. Professor Guildenstern ﬂips a fair
       coin twice. What is the probability that Professor Rosencrantz obtains more heads
       than Professor Guildenstern?
