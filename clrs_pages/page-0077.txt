56   Chapter 3 Growth of Functions


     where “Š” denotes the factorial function deﬁned later in this section. For all real x,
     we have the inequality
     ex  1 C x ;                                                                   (3.12)
     where equality holds only when x D 0. When jxj  1, we have the approximation
     1 C x  ex  1 C x C x 2 :                                                     (3.13)
                                             x
     When x ! 0, the approximation of e by 1 C x is quite good:
     e x D 1 C x C ‚.x 2 / :
     (In this equation, the asymptotic notation is used to describe the limiting behavior
     as x ! 0 rather than as x ! 1.) We have for all x,
                x n
      lim 1 C         D ex :                                                       (3.14)

     Logarithms
     We shall use the following notations:
        lg n   D   log2 n     (binary logarithm) ,
        ln n   D   loge n     (natural logarithm) ,
      lgk n    D   .lg n/k    (exponentiation) ,
     lg lg n   D   lg.lg n/   (composition) .
     An important notational convention we shall adopt is that logarithm functions will
     apply only to the next term in the formula, so that lg n C k will mean .lg n/ C k
     and not lg.n C k/. If we hold b > 1 constant, then for n > 0, the function logb n
     is strictly increasing.
        For all real a > 0, b > 0, c > 0, and n,
               a D b logb a ;
      logc .ab/ D logc a C logc b ;
        logb an D n logb a ;
                    logc a
         logb a D              ;                                                    (3.15)
                    logc b
     logb .1=a/ D  logb a ;
                        1
         logb a D              ;
                    loga b
          alogb c D c logb a ;                                                      (3.16)
     where, in each equation above, logarithm bases are not 1.
