Interpreting keys as natural numbers
Most hash functions assume that the universe of keys is the set N D f0; 1; 2; : : :g
of natural numbers. Thus, if the keys are not natural numbers, we ﬁnd a way to
interpret them as natural numbers. For example, we can interpret a character string
as an integer expressed in suitable radix notation. Thus, we might interpret the
identiﬁer pt as the pair of decimal integers .112; 116/, since p D 112 and t D 116
in the ASCII character set; then, expressed as a radix-128 integer, pt becomes
.112  128/ C 116 D 14452. In the context of a given application, we can usually
devise some such method for interpreting each key as a (possibly large) natural
number. In what follows, we assume that the keys are natural numbers.

11.3.1   The division method
In the division method for creating hash functions, we map a key k into one of m
slots by taking the remainder of k divided by m. That is, the hash function is
h.k/ D k mod m :
For example, if the hash table has size m D 12 and the key is k D 100, then
h.k/ D 4. Since it requires only a single division operation, hashing by division is
quite fast.
    When using the division method, we usually avoid certain values of m. For
example, m should not be a power of 2, since if m D 2p , then h.k/ is just the p
lowest-order bits of k. Unless we know that all low-order p-bit patterns are equally
likely, we are better off designing the hash function to depend on all the bits of the
key. As Exercise 11.3-3 asks you to show, choosing m D 2p  1 when k is a
character string interpreted in radix 2p may be a poor choice, because permuting
the characters of k does not change its hash value.
    A prime not too close to an exact power of 2 is often a good choice for m. For
example, suppose we wish to allocate a hash table, with collisions resolved by
chaining, to hold roughly n D 2000 character strings, where a character has 8 bits.
We don’t mind examining an average of 3 elements in an unsuccessful search, and
so we allocate a hash table of size m D 701. We could choose m D 701 because
it is a prime near 2000=3 but not near any power of 2. Treating each key k as an
integer, our hash function would be
h.k/ D k mod 701 :


11.3.2   The multiplication method
The multiplication method for creating hash functions operates in two steps. First,
we multiply the key k by a constant A in the range 0 < A < 1 and extract the
