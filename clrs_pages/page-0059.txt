     Figure 2.5 How to construct a recursion tree for the recurrence T .n/ D 2T .n=2/ C cn.
     Part (a) shows T .n/, which progressively expands in (b)–(d) to form the recursion tree. The fully
     expanded tree in part (d) has lg n C 1 levels (i.e., it has height lg n, as indicated), and each level
     contributes a total cost of cn. The total cost, therefore, is cn lg n C cn, which is ‚.n lg n/.
