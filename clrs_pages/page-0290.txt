           11.3-3
           Consider a version of the division method in which h.k/ D k mod m, where
           m D 2p  1 and k is a character string interpreted in radix 2p . Show that if we
           can derive string x from string y by permuting its characters, then x and y hash to
           the same value. Give an example of an application in which this property would be
           undesirable in a hash function.

           11.3-4
           Consider a hash table of sizepm D 1000 and a corresponding hash function h.k/ D
           bm .kA mod 1/c for A D . 5  1/=2. Compute the locations to which the keys
           61, 62, 63, 64, and 65 are mapped.

           Deﬁne a family H of hash functions from a ﬁnite set U to a ﬁnite set B to be
           -universal if for all pairs of distinct elements k and l in U ,
           Pr fh.k/ D h.l/g   ;
           where the probability is over the choice of the hash function h drawn at random
           from the family H . Show that an -universal family of hash functions must have

           Let U be the set of n-tuples of values drawn from Zp , and let B D Zp , where p
           is prime. Deﬁne the hash function hb W U ! B for b 2 Zp on an input n-tuple

           the deﬁnition of -universal in Exercise 11.3-5. (Hint: See Exercise 31.4-4.)



11.4 Open addressing

           In open addressing, all elements occupy the hash table itself. That is, each table
           entry contains either an element of the dynamic set or NIL. When searching for
           an element, we systematically examine table slots until either we ﬁnd the desired
           element or we have ascertained that the element is not in the table. No lists and
