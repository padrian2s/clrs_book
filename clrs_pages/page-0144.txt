this to be the case for any input, rather than for inputs drawn from a particular
distribution.
   Let us further explore the distinction between probabilistic analysis and random-
ized algorithms. In Section 5.2, we claimed that, assuming that the candidates ar-
rive in a random order, the expected number of times we hire a new ofﬁce assistant
is about ln n. Note that the algorithm here is deterministic; for any particular input,
the number of times a new ofﬁce assistant is hired is always the same. Furthermore,
the number of times we hire a new ofﬁce assistant differs for different inputs, and it
depends on the ranks of the various candidates. Since this number depends only on
the ranks of the candidates, we can represent a particular input by listing, in order,
the ranks of the candidates, i.e., hrank.1/; rank.2/; : : : ; rank.n/i. Given the rank
list A1 D h1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10i, a new ofﬁce assistant is always hired 10 times,
since each successive candidate is better than the previous one, and lines 5–6 are
executed in each iteration. Given the list of ranks A2 D h10; 9; 8; 7; 6; 5; 4; 3; 2; 1i,
a new ofﬁce assistant is hired only once, in the ﬁrst iteration. Given a list of ranks
A3 D h5; 2; 1; 8; 4; 7; 10; 9; 3; 6i, a new ofﬁce assistant is hired three times,
upon interviewing the candidates with ranks 5, 8, and 10. Recalling that the cost
of our algorithm depends on how many times we hire a new ofﬁce assistant, we
see that there are expensive inputs such as A1 , inexpensive inputs such as A2 , and
moderately expensive inputs such as A3 .
   Consider, on the other hand, the randomized algorithm that ﬁrst permutes the
candidates and then determines the best candidate. In this case, we randomize in
the algorithm, not in the input distribution. Given a particular input, say A3 above,
we cannot say how many times the maximum is updated, because this quantity
differs with each run of the algorithm. The ﬁrst time we run the algorithm on A3 ,
it may produce the permutation A1 and perform 10 updates; but the second time
we run the algorithm, we may produce the permutation A2 and perform only one
update. The third time we run it, we may perform some other number of updates.
Each time we run the algorithm, the execution depends on the random choices
made and is likely to differ from the previous execution of the algorithm. For this
algorithm and many other randomized algorithms, no particular input elicits its
worst-case behavior. Even your worst enemy cannot produce a bad input array,
since the random permutation makes the input order irrelevant. The randomized
algorithm performs badly only if the random-number generator produces an “un-
lucky” permutation.
   For the hiring problem, the only change needed in the code is to randomly per-
mute the array.
