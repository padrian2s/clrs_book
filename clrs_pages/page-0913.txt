892   Chapter 29 Linear Programming


      Theorem 29.13 (Fundamental theorem of linear programming)
      Any linear program L, given in standard form, either
      1. has an optimal solution with a ﬁnite objective value,
      2. is infeasible, or
      3. is unbounded.
      If L is infeasible, S IMPLEX returns “infeasible.” If L is unbounded, S IMPLEX
      returns “unbounded.” Otherwise, S IMPLEX returns an optimal solution with a ﬁnite
      objective value.

      Proof By Lemma 29.12, if linear program L is infeasible, then S IMPLEX returns
      “infeasible.” Now suppose that the linear program L is feasible. By Lemma 29.12,
      I NITIALIZE -S IMPLEX returns a slack form for which the basic solution is feasible.
      By Lemma 29.7, therefore, S IMPLEX either returns “unbounded” or terminates
      with a feasible solution. If it terminates with a ﬁnite solution, then Theorem 29.10
      tells us that this solution is optimal. On the other hand, if S IMPLEX returns “un-
      bounded,” Lemma 29.2 tells us the linear program L is indeed unbounded. Since
      S IMPLEX always terminates in one of these ways, the proof is complete.

      Exercises

      29.5-1
      Give detailed pseudocode to implement lines 5 and 14 of I NITIALIZE -S IMPLEX.

      29.5-2
      Show that when the main loop of S IMPLEX is run by I NITIALIZE -S IMPLEX, it can
      never return “unbounded.”

      29.5-3
      Suppose that we are given a linear program L in standard form, and suppose that
      for both L and the dual of L, the basic solutions associated with the initial slack
      forms are feasible. Show that the optimal objective value of L is 0.

      29.5-4
      Suppose that we allow strict inequalities in a linear program. Show that in this
      case, the fundamental theorem of linear programming does not hold.
