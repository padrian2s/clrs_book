                    Figure 34.17 Reducing an instance of the vertex-cover problem to an instance of the hamiltonian-
                    cycle problem. (a) An undirected graph G with a vertex cover of size 2, consisting of the lightly
                    shaded vertices w and y. (b) The undirected graph G 0 produced by the reduction, with the hamilto-
                    nian path corresponding to the vertex cover shaded. The vertex cover fw; yg corresponds to edges
                    .s1 ; Œw; x; 1/ and .s2 ; Œy; x; 1/ appearing in the hamiltonian cycle.


                        The only other vertices in V 0 other than those of widgets are selector vertices
                    s1 ; s2 ; : : : ; sk . We use edges incident on selector vertices in G 0 to select the k
                    vertices of the cover in G.
                        In addition to the edges in widgets, E 0 contains two other types of edges, which
                    Figure 34.17 shows. First, for each vertex u 2 V , we add edges to join pairs
                    of widgets in order to form a path containing all widgets corresponding to edges
                    incident on u in G. We arbitrarily order the vertices adjacent to each vertex
                    u 2 V as u.1/ ; u.2/ ; : : : ; u.degree.u// , where degree.u/ is the number of vertices
                    adjacent to u. We create a path in G 0 through all the widgets corresponding
                    to edges incident on u by adding to E 0 the edges f.Œu; u.i / ; 6; Œu; u.i C1/ ; 1/ W
                    1  i  degree.u/  1g. In Figure 34.17, for example, we order the vertices ad-
                    jacent to w as x; y; ´, and so graph G 0 in part (b) of the ﬁgure includes the edges
