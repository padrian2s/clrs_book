Sums of squares and cubes
We have the following summations of squares and cubes:
Xn
             n.n C 1/.2n C 1/
   k2 D                       ;                                               (A.3)
                     6
kD0
Xn
              n2 .n C 1/2
      k3 D                :                                                   (A.4)
                   4
kD0


Geometric series
For real x ¤ 1, the summation
Xn
    xk D 1 C x C x2 C    C xn
kD0

is a geometric or exponential series and has the value
X n
          x nC1  1
     xk D           :                                                         (A.5)
            x1
kD0

When the summation is inﬁnite and jxj < 1, we have the inﬁnite decreasing geo-
metric series
X
1
             1
   xk D        :                                                         (A.6)
           1x
kD0


Harmonic series
For positive integers n, the nth harmonic number is
               1 1        1         1
Hn D 1 C C C C    C
               2 3        4         n

      D ln n C O.1/ :                                                         (A.7)
(We shall prove a related bound in Section A.2.)

Integrating and differentiating series
By integrating or differentiating the formulas above, additional formulas arise. For
example, by differentiating both sides of the inﬁnite geometric series (A.6) and
multiplying by x, we get
