      tion. We call the resulting format slack form. If we write the linear program given
      in (29.33)–(29.37) in slack form, we obtain
       ´   D           2x1           3x2      C 3x3                                 (29.38)
      x4   D  7       x1            x2       C x3                                  (29.39)
      x5   D 7      C x1           C x2        x3                                  (29.40)
      x6   D  4       x1           C 2x2       2x3 :                               (29.41)
          As with standard form, we ﬁnd it convenient to have a more concise notation
      for describing a slack form. As we shall see in Section 29.3, the sets of basic and
      nonbasic variables will change as the simplex algorithm runs. We use N to denote
      the set of indices of the nonbasic variables and B to denote the set of indices of
      the basic variables. We always have that jN j D n, jBj D m, and N [ B D
      f1; 2; : : : ; n C mg. The equations are indexed by the entries of B, and the variables
      on the right-hand sides are indexed by the entries of N . As in standard form, we use
      bi , cj , and aij to denote constant terms and coefﬁcients. We also use  to denote
      an optional constant term in the objective function. (We shall see a little later that
      including the constant term in the objective function makes it easy to determine the
      value of the objective function.) Thus we can concisely deﬁne a slack form by a
      tuple .N; B; A; b; c; /, denoting the slack form
                             X
       ´ D  C                  cj xj                                                (29.42)
                         j 2N
                         X
      xi   D bi                aij xj   for i 2 B ;                                 (29.43)
                         j 2N

      in which Pall variables x are constrained to be nonnegative. Because we subtract
      the sum j 2N aij xj in (29.43), the values aij are actually the negatives of the
      coefﬁcients as they “appear” in the slack form.
         For example, in the slack form
                           x3             x5           2x6
       ´ D 28                                 
                            6              6            3
                           x3             x5            x6
      x1 D      8    C              C           

                           3              3              3
                           x3             x5
      x4 D 18                      C          ;
