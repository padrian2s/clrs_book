22.2 Breadth-ﬁrst search                                                                         597


adjacency list, it blackens u in line 18. The loop invariant is maintained because
whenever a vertex is painted gray (in line 14) it is also enqueued (in line 17), and
whenever a vertex is dequeued (in line 11) it is also painted black (in line 18).
   The results of breadth-ﬁrst search may depend upon the order in which the neigh-
bors of a given vertex are visited in line 12: the breadth-ﬁrst tree may vary, but the
distances d computed by the algorithm will not. (See Exercise 22.2-5.)

Analysis
Before proving the various properties of breadth-ﬁrst search, we take on the some-
what easier job of analyzing its running time on an input graph G D .V; E/. We
use aggregate analysis, as we saw in Section 17.1. After initialization, breadth-ﬁrst
search never whitens a vertex, and thus the test in line 13 ensures that each vertex
is enqueued at most once, and hence dequeued at most once. The operations of
enqueuing and dequeuing take O.1/ time, and so the total time devoted to queue
operations is O.V /. Because the procedure scans the adjacency list of each vertex
only when the vertex is dequeued, it scans each adjacency list at most once. Since
the sum of the lengths of all the adjacency lists is ‚.E/, the total time spent in
scanning adjacency lists is O.E/. The overhead for initialization is O.V /, and
thus the total running time of the BFS procedure is O.V C E/. Thus, breadth-ﬁrst
search runs in time linear in the size of the adjacency-list representation of G.

Shortest paths
At the beginning of this section, we claimed that breadth-ﬁrst search ﬁnds the dis-
tance to each reachable vertex in a graph G D .V; E/ from a given source vertex
s 2 V . Deﬁne the shortest-path distance ı.s; / from s to  as the minimum num-
ber of edges in any path from vertex s to vertex ; if there is no path from s to ,
then ı.s; / D 1. We call a path of length ı.s; / from s to  a shortest path2
from s to . Before showing that breadth-ﬁrst search correctly computes shortest-
path distances, we investigate an important property of shortest-path distances.


2 In Chapters 24 and 25, we shall generalize our study of shortest paths to weighted graphs, in which

every edge has a real-valued weight and the weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its con-
stituent edges. The graphs considered in the present chapter are unweighted or, equivalently, all
edges have unit weight.
