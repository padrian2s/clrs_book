      Figure 10.4 shows the effects of L IST-I NSERT 0 and L IST-D ELETE 0 on a sample list.
         Sentinels rarely reduce the asymptotic time bounds of data structure operations,
      but they can reduce constant factors. The gain from using sentinels within loops
      is usually a matter of clarity of code rather than speed; the linked list code, for
      example, becomes simpler when we use sentinels, but we save only O.1/ time in
      the L IST-I NSERT 0 and L IST-D ELETE 0 procedures. In other situations, however, the
      use of sentinels helps to tighten the code in a loop, thus reducing the coefﬁcient of,
      say, n or n2 in the running time.
         We should use sentinels judiciously. When there are many small lists, the extra
      storage used by their sentinels can represent signiﬁcant wasted memory. In this
      book, we use sentinels only when they truly simplify the code.

      Exercises

      10.2-1
      Can you implement the dynamic-set operation I NSERT on a singly linked list
      in O.1/ time? How about D ELETE?

      10.2-2
      Implement a stack using a singly linked list L. The operations P USH and P OP
      should still take O.1/ time.

      10.2-3
      Implement a queue by a singly linked list L. The operations E NQUEUE and D E -
      QUEUE should still take O.1/ time.

      10.2-4
      As written, each loop iteration in the L IST-S EARCH 0 procedure requires two tests:
      one for x ¤ L:nil and one for x:key ¤ k. Show how to eliminate the test for
      x ¤ L:nil in each iteration.

      10.2-5
      Implement the dictionary operations I NSERT, D ELETE, and S EARCH using singly
      linked, circular lists. What are the running times of your procedures?
