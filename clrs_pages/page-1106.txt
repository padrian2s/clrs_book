34.4 NP-completeness proofs                                                        1085


    exactly 3 distinct literals. Whether p D 0 or p D 1, one of the clauses is
    equivalent to l1 _ l2 , and the other evaluates to 1, which is the identity for AND.
   If Ci has just 1 distinct literal l, then include .l _ p _ q/ ^ .l _ p _ :q/ ^
    .l _ :p _ q/ ^ .l _ :p _ :q/ as clauses of  000 . Regardless of the values of p
    and q, one of the four clauses is equivalent to l, and the other 3 evaluate to 1.
   We can see that the 3-CNF formula  000 is satisﬁable if and only if  is satisﬁable
by inspecting each of the three steps. Like the reduction from CIRCUIT-SAT to
SAT, the construction of  0 from  in the ﬁrst step preserves satisﬁability. The
second step produces a CNF formula  00 that is algebraically equivalent to  0 . The
third step produces a 3-CNF formula  000 that is effectively equivalent to  00 , since
any assignment to the variables p and q produces a formula that is algebraically
equivalent to  00 .
   We must also show that the reduction can be computed in polynomial time. Con-
structing  0 from  introduces at most 1 variable and 1 clause per connective in .
Constructing  00 from  0 can introduce at most 8 clauses into  00 for each clause
from  0 , since each clause of  0 has at most 3 variables, and the truth table for
each clause has at most 23 D 8 rows. The construction of  000 from  00 introduces
at most 4 clauses into  000 for each clause of  00 . Thus, the size of the resulting
formula  000 is polynomial in the length of the original formula. Each of the con-
structions can easily be accomplished in polynomial time.

Exercises

34.4-1
Consider the straightforward (nonpolynomial-time) reduction in the proof of The-
orem 34.9. Describe a circuit of size n that, when converted to a formula by this
method, yields a formula whose size is exponential in n.

34.4-2
Show the 3-CNF formula that results when we use the method of Theorem 34.10
on the formula (34.3).

34.4-3
Professor Jagger proposes to show that SAT P 3-CNF-SAT by using only the
truth-table technique in the proof of Theorem 34.10, and not the other steps. That
is, the professor proposes to take the boolean formula , form a truth table for
its variables, derive from the truth table a formula in 3-DNF that is equivalent
to :, and then negate and apply DeMorgan’s laws to produce a 3-CNF formula
equivalent to . Show that this strategy does not yield a polynomial-time reduction.
