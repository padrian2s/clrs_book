3.2 Standard notations and common functions                                      59


Since the number of atoms in the observable universe is estimated to be about 1080 ,
which is much less than 265536 , we rarely encounter an input size n such that
lg n > 5.

Fibonacci numbers
We deﬁne the Fibonacci numbers by the following recurrence:
F0 D 0 ;
F1 D 1 ;                                                                     (3.22)
Fi D Fi 1 C Fi 2           for i  2 :
Thus, each Fibonacci number is the sum of the two previous ones, yielding the
sequence
0; 1; 1; 2; 3; 5; 8; 13; 21; 34; 55; : : : :
                                                                         y which
Fibonacci numbers are related to the golden ratio  and to its conjugate ,
are the two roots of the equation
x2 D x C 1                                                                   (3.23)
and are given by the following formulas (see Exercise 3.2-6):
             p

Speciﬁcally, we have
