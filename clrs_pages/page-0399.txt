           15.2-1
           Find an optimal parenthesization of a matrix-chain product whose sequence of
           dimensions is h5; 10; 3; 12; 5; 50; 6i.

           15.2-2
           Give a recursive algorithm M ATRIX -C HAIN -M ULTIPLY .A; s; i; j / that actually
           performs the optimal matrix-chain multiplication, given the sequence of matrices
           hA1 ; A2 ; : : : ; An i, the s table computed by M ATRIX -C HAIN -O RDER, and the in-
           dices i and j . (The initial call would be M ATRIX -C HAIN -M ULTIPLY .A; s; 1; n/.)

           15.2-3
           Use the substitution method to show that the solution to the recurrence (15.6)
           is .2n /.

           15.2-4
           Describe the subproblem graph for matrix-chain multiplication with an input chain
           of length n. How many vertices does it have? How many edges does it have, and
           which edges are they?

           15.2-5
           Let R.i; j / be the number of times that table entry mŒi; j  is referenced while
           computing other table entries in a call of M ATRIX -C HAIN -O RDER. Show that the
           total number of references for the entire table is
           X

           (Hint: You may ﬁnd equation (A.3) useful.)

           15.2-6
           Show that a full parenthesization of an n-element expression has exactly n1 pairs
           of parentheses.



15.3 Elements of dynamic programming

           Although we have just worked through two examples of the dynamic-programming
           method, you might still be wondering just when the method applies. From an en-
           gineering perspective, when should we look for a dynamic-programming solution
           to a problem? In this section, we examine the two key ingredients that an opti-
