       The algorithm returns ´ D 302 as its answer, which is well within  D 40% of
       the optimal answer 307 D 104 C 102 C 101; in fact, it is within 2%.

       Theorem 35.8
       A PPROX -S UBSET-S UM is a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the
       subset-sum problem.

       Proof The operations of trimming Li in line 5 and removing from Li every ele-
       ment that is greater than t maintain the property that every element of Li is also a
       member of Pi . Therefore, the value ´ returned in line 8 is indeed the sum of some
       subset of S. Let y  2 Pn denote an optimal solution to the subset-sum problem.
       Then, from line 6, we know that ´  y  . By inequality (35.1), we need to show
       that y  =´  1 C . We must also show that the running time of this algorithm is
       polynomial in both 1= and the size of the input.
          As Exercise 35.5-2 asks you to show, for every element y in Pi that is at most t,
       there exists an element ´ 2 Li such that
             y
                     ´y:                                                          (35.26)
       .1 C =2n/i
       Inequality (35.26) must hold for y  2 Pn , and therefore there exists an element
       ´ 2 Ln such that
           y
                    ´  y ;
       .1 C =2n/n
       and thus
       y        n
            1C       :                                                            (35.27)
        ´       2n
       Since there exists an element ´ 2 Ln fulﬁlling inequality (35.27), the inequality
       must hold for ´ , which is the largest value in Ln ; that is,
       y           n
              1 C         :                                                     (35.28)
       ´          2n
         Now, we show that y  =´  1 C . We do so by showing that .1 C =2n/n 
       1 C . By equation (3.14), we have limn!1 .1 C =2n/n D e =2 . Exercise 35.5-3
       asks you to show that
        d         n
            1C         >0:                                                     (35.29)
       dn        2n
       Therefore, the function .1 C =2n/n increases with n as it approaches its limit
       of e =2 , and we have
