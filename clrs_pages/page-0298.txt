           11.4-1
           Consider inserting the keys 10; 22; 31; 4; 15; 28; 17; 88; 59 into a hash table of
           length m D 11 using open addressing with the auxiliary hash function h0 .k/ D k.
           Illustrate the result of inserting these keys using linear probing, using quadratic
           probing with c1 D 1 and c2 D 3, and using double hashing with h1 .k/ D k and
           h2 .k/ D 1 C .k mod .m  1//.

           11.4-2
           Write pseudocode for H ASH -D ELETE as outlined in the text, and modify H ASH -
           I NSERT to handle the special value DELETED.

           11.4-3
           Consider an open-address hash table with uniform hashing. Give upper bounds
           on the expected number of probes in an unsuccessful search and on the expected
           number of probes in a successful search when the load factor is 3=4 and when it
           is 7=8.

           11.4-4 ?
           Suppose that we use double hashing to resolve collisions—that is, we use the hash
           function h.k; i/ D .h1 .k/ C ih2 .k// mod m. Show that if m and h2 .k/ have
           greatest common divisor d  1 for some key k, then an unsuccessful search for
           key k examines .1=d /th of the hash table before returning to slot h1 .k/. Thus,
           when d D 1, so that m and h2 .k/ are relatively prime, the search may examine the
           entire hash table. (Hint: See Chapter 31.)

           11.4-5 ?
           Consider an open-address hash table with a load factor ˛. Find the nonzero value ˛
           for which the expected number of probes in an unsuccessful search equals twice
           the expected number of probes in a successful search. Use the upper bounds given
           by Theorems 11.6 and 11.8 for these expected numbers of probes.

           Although hashing is often a good choice for its excellent average-case perfor-
           mance, hashing can also provide excellent worst-case performance when the set of
           keys is static: once the keys are stored in the table, the set of keys never changes.
           Some applications naturally have static sets of keys: consider the set of reserved
           words in a programming language, or the set of ﬁle names on a CD-ROM. We
