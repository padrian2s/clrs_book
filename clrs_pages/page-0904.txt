For the basic solution xN associated with this ﬁnal slack form, xNj D 0 for all j 2 N ,
and ´ D  0 . Since all slack forms are equivalent, if we evaluate the original objec-
tive function on Nx, we must obtain the same objective value:

   We shall now show that N      y, deﬁned by equation
                                                Pm (29.91), is feasible

linear program and that its objective value i D1 bi yNi equals j D1 cj xNj . Equa-
tion (29.97) says that the ﬁrst and last slack forms, evaluated at Nx, are equal. More
generally, the equivalence of all slack forms implies that for any set of values
x D .x1 ; x2 ; : : : ; xn /, we have
