4.1 The maximum-subarray problem                                                   73


The initial call F IND -M AXIMUM -S UBARRAY .A; 1; A:length/ will ﬁnd a maxi-
mum subarray of AŒ1 : : n.
   Similar to F IND -M AX -C ROSSING -S UBARRAY, the recursive procedure F IND -
M AXIMUM -S UBARRAY returns a tuple containing the indices that demarcate a
maximum subarray, along with the sum of the values in a maximum subarray.
Line 1 tests for the base case, where the subarray has just one element. A subar-
ray with just one element has only one subarray—itself—and so line 2 returns a
tuple with the starting and ending indices of just the one element, along with its
value. Lines 3–11 handle the recursive case. Line 3 does the divide part, comput-
ing the index mid of the midpoint. Let’s refer to the subarray AŒlow : : mid as the
left subarray and to AŒmid C 1 : : high as the right subarray. Because we know
that the subarray AŒlow : : high contains at least two elements, each of the left and
right subarrays must have at least one element. Lines 4 and 5 conquer by recur-
sively ﬁnding maximum subarrays within the left and right subarrays, respectively.
Lines 6–11 form the combine part. Line 6 ﬁnds a maximum subarray that crosses
the midpoint. (Recall that because line 6 solves a subproblem that is not a smaller
instance of the original problem, we consider it to be in the combine part.) Line 7
tests whether the left subarray contains a subarray with the maximum sum, and
line 8 returns that maximum subarray. Otherwise, line 9 tests whether the right
subarray contains a subarray with the maximum sum, and line 10 returns that max-
imum subarray. If neither the left nor right subarrays contain a subarray achieving
the maximum sum, then a maximum subarray must cross the midpoint, and line 11
returns it.

Analyzing the divide-and-conquer algorithm
Next we set up a recurrence that describes the running time of the recursive F IND -
M AXIMUM -S UBARRAY procedure. As we did when we analyzed merge sort in
Section 2.3.2, we make the simplifying assumption that the original problem size
is a power of 2, so that all subproblem sizes are integers. We denote by T .n/ the
running time of F IND -M AXIMUM -S UBARRAY on a subarray of n elements. For
starters, line 1 takes constant time. The base case, when n D 1, is easy: line 2
takes constant time, and so
T .1/ D ‚.1/ :                                                                  (4.5)
   The recursive case occurs when n > 1. Lines 1 and 3 take constant time. Each
of the subproblems solved in lines 4 and 5 is on a subarray of n=2 elements (our
assumption that the original problem size is a power of 2 ensures that n=2 is an
integer), and so we spend T .n=2/ time solving each of them. Because we have
to solve two subproblems—for the left subarray and for the right subarray—the
contribution to the running time from lines 4 and 5 comes to 2T .n=2/. As we have
