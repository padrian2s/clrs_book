      Order statistics
      The ith order statistic of a set of n numbers is the ith smallest number in the set.
      We can, of course, select the ith order statistic by sorting the input and indexing
      the ith element of the output. With no assumptions about the input distribution,
      this method runs in .n lg n/ time, as the lower bound proved in Chapter 8 shows.
         In Chapter 9, we show that we can ﬁnd the ith smallest element in O.n/ time,
      even when the elements are arbitrary real numbers. We present a randomized algo-
      rithm with tight pseudocode that runs in ‚.n2 / time in the worst case, but whose
      expected running time is O.n/. We also give a more complicated algorithm that
      runs in O.n/ worst-case time.

      Background
      Although most of this part does not rely on difﬁcult mathematics, some sections
      do require mathematical sophistication. In particular, analyses of quicksort, bucket
      sort, and the order-statistic algorithm use probability, which is reviewed in Ap-
      pendix C, and the material on probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms in
      Chapter 5. The analysis of the worst-case linear-time algorithm for order statis-
      tics involves somewhat more sophisticated mathematics than the other worst-case
      analyses in this part.
