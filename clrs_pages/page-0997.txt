      Pollard’s rho heuristic
      Trial division by all integers up to R is guaranteed to factor completely any number
      up to R2 . For the same amount of work, the following procedure, P OLLARD -R HO,
      factors any number up to R4 (unless we are unlucky). Since the procedure is only
      a heuristic, neither its running time nor its success is guaranteed, although the
      procedure is highly effective in practice. Another advantage of the P OLLARD -
      R HO procedure is that it uses only a constant number of memory locations. (If you
      wanted to, you could easily implement P OLLARD -R HO on a programmable pocket
      calculator to ﬁnd factors of small numbers.)

      P OLLARD -R HO .n/
       1 i D1
       2 x1 D R ANDOM .0; n  1/
       3 y D x1
       4 k D2
       5 while TRUE
       6     i D i C1
       7     xi D .xi21  1/ mod n
       8     d D gcd.y  xi ; n/
       9     if d ¤ 1 and d ¤ n
      10           print d
      11     if i == k
      12           y D xi
      13           k D 2k

         The procedure works as follows. Lines 1–2 initialize i to 1 and x1 to a randomly
      chosen value in Zn . The while loop beginning on line 5 iterates forever, searching
      for factors of n. During each iteration of the while loop, line 7 uses the recurrence
      xi D .xi21  1/ mod n                                                       (31.43)
      to produce the next value of xi in the inﬁnite sequence
      x1 ; x2 ; x3 ; x4 ; : : : ;                                                  (31.44)
      with line 6 correspondingly incrementing i. The pseudocode is written using sub-
      scripted variables xi for clarity, but the program works the same if all of the sub-
      scripts are dropped, since only the most recent value of xi needs to be maintained.
      With this modiﬁcation, the procedure uses only a constant number of memory lo-
      cations.
         Every so often, the program saves the most recently generated xi value in the
      variable y. Speciﬁcally, the values that are saved are the ones whose subscripts are
      powers of 2:
