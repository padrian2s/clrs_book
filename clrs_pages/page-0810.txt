ing the dependencies among individual instructions. The processor registers are r1 and r2 . Instruc-

printed. Conversely, if the effect were that processor 2 executed all its instructions
before processor 1, the value 2 would still be printed. When the instructions of the
two processors execute at the same time, however, it is possible, as in this example
execution, that one of the updates to x is lost.
   Of course, many executions do not elicit the bug. For example, if the execution
order were h1; 2; 3; 7; 4; 5; 6; 8i or h1; 4; 5; 6; 2; 3; 7; 8i, we would get the cor-
rect result. That’s the problem with determinacy races. Generally, most orderings
produce correct results—such as any in which the instructions on the left execute
before the instructions on the right, or vice versa. But some orderings generate
improper results when the instructions interleave. Consequently, races can be ex-
tremely hard to test for. You can run tests for days and never see the bug, only to
experience a catastrophic system crash in the field when the outcome is critical.
   Although we can cope with races in a variety of ways, including using mutual-
exclusion locks and other methods of synchronization, for our purposes, we shall
simply ensure that strands that operate in parallel are independent: they have no
determinacy races among them. Thus, in a parallel for construct, all the iterations
should be independent. Between a spawn and the corresponding sync, the code
of the spawned child should be independent of the code of the parent, including
code executed by additional spawned or called children. Note that arguments to a
spawned child are evaluated in the parent before the actual spawn occurs, and thus
the evaluation of arguments to a spawned subroutine is in series with any accesses
to those arguments after the spawn.
