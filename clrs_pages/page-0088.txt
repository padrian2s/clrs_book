Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer                                                      67


   Occasionally, we shall see recurrences that are not equalities but rather inequal-
ities, such as T .n/  2T .n=2/ C ‚.n/. Because such a recurrence states only
an upper bound on T .n/, we will couch its solution using O-notation rather than
‚-notation. Similarly, if the inequality were reversed to T .n/  2T .n=2/ C ‚.n/,
then because the recurrence gives only a lower bound on T .n/, we would use
-notation in its solution.

Technicalities in recurrences
In practice, we neglect certain technical details when we state and solve recur-
rences. For example, if we call M ERGE -S ORT on n elements when n is odd, we
end up with subproblems of size bn=2c and dn=2e. Neither size is actually n=2,
because n=2 is not an integer when n is odd. Technically, the recurrence describing
the worst-case running time of M ERGE -S ORT is really
         (
           ‚.1/                              if n D 1 ;
T .n/ D                                                                        (4.3)
           T .dn=2e/ C T .bn=2c/ C ‚.n/ if n > 1 :

   Boundary conditions represent another class of details that we typically ignore.
Since the running time of an algorithm on a constant-sized input is a constant,
the recurrences that arise from the running times of algorithms generally have
T .n/ D ‚.1/ for sufﬁciently small n. Consequently, for convenience, we shall
generally omit statements of the boundary conditions of recurrences and assume
that T .n/ is constant for small n. For example, we normally state recurrence (4.1)
as
T .n/ D 2T .n=2/ C ‚.n/ ;                                                       (4.4)
without explicitly giving values for small n. The reason is that although changing
the value of T .1/ changes the exact solution to the recurrence, the solution typi-
cally doesn’t change by more than a constant factor, and so the order of growth is
unchanged.
   When we state and solve recurrences, we often omit ﬂoors, ceilings, and bound-
ary conditions. We forge ahead without these details and later determine whether
or not they matter. They usually do not, but you should know when they do. Ex-
perience helps, and so do some theorems stating that these details do not affect the
asymptotic bounds of many recurrences characterizing divide-and-conquer algo-
rithms (see Theorem 4.1). In this chapter, however, we shall address some of these
details and illustrate the ﬁne points of recurrence solution methods.
