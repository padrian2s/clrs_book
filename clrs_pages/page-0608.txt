Introduction

               Graph problems pervade computer science, and algorithms for working with them
               are fundamental to the ﬁeld. Hundreds of interesting computational problems are
               couched in terms of graphs. In this part, we touch on a few of the more signiﬁcant
               ones.
                  Chapter 22 shows how we can represent a graph in a computer and then discusses
               algorithms based on searching a graph using either breadth-ﬁrst search or depth-
               ﬁrst search. The chapter gives two applications of depth-ﬁrst search: topologically
               sorting a directed acyclic graph and decomposing a directed graph into its strongly
               connected components.
                  Chapter 23 describes how to compute a minimum-weight spanning tree of a
               graph: the least-weight way of connecting all of the vertices together when each
               edge has an associated weight. The algorithms for computing minimum spanning
               trees serve as good examples of greedy algorithms (see Chapter 16).
                  Chapters 24 and 25 consider how to compute shortest paths between vertices
               when each edge has an associated length or “weight.” Chapter 24 shows how to
               ﬁnd shortest paths from a given source vertex to all other vertices, and Chapter 25
               examines methods to compute shortest paths between every pair of vertices.
                  Finally, Chapter 26 shows how to compute a maximum ﬂow of material in a ﬂow
               network, which is a directed graph having a speciﬁed source vertex of material, a
               speciﬁed sink vertex, and speciﬁed capacities for the amount of material that can
               traverse each directed edge. This general problem arises in many forms, and a
               good algorithm for computing maximum ﬂows can help solve a variety of related
               problems efﬁciently.
