      This slack form has a feasible basic solution, and we can return it to procedure
      S IMPLEX.
         We now formally show the correctness of I NITIALIZE -S IMPLEX.

      Lemma 29.12
      If a linear program L has no feasible solution, then I NITIALIZE -S IMPLEX returns
      “infeasible.” Otherwise, it returns a valid slack form for which the basic solution
      is feasible.

      Proof First suppose that the linear program L has no feasible solution. Then by
      Lemma 29.11, the optimal objective value of Laux , deﬁned in (29.106)–(29.108),
      is nonzero, and by the nonnegativity constraint on x0 , the optimal objective value
      must be negative. Furthermore, this objective value must be ﬁnite, since setting
      xi D 0, for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n, and x0 D jminm   i D1 fbi gj is feasible, and this solution
      has objective value  jminm   i D1 fb i gj. Therefore,  line 10 of I NITIALIZE -S IMPLEX
      ﬁnds a solution with a nonpositive objective value. Let xN be the basic solution
      associated with the ﬁnal slack form. We cannot have xN 0 D 0, because then Laux
      would have objective value 0, which contradicts that the objective value is negative.
      Thus the test in line 11 results in line 16 returning “infeasible.”
         Suppose now that the linear program L does have a feasible solution. From
      Exercise 29.3-4, we know that if bi  0 for i D 1; 2; : : : ; m, then the basic solution
      associated with the initial slack form is feasible. In this case, lines 2–3 return the
      slack form associated with the input. (Converting the standard form to slack form
      is easy, since A, b, and c are the same in both.)
         In the remainder of the proof, we handle the case in which the linear program is
      feasible but we do not return in line 3. We argue that in this case, lines 4–10 ﬁnd a
      feasible solution to Laux with objective value 0. First, by lines 1–2, we must have
      bk < 0 ;
      and
      bk  bi for each i 2 B :                                                          (29.112)
      In line 8, we perform one pivot operation in which the leaving variable xl (recall
      that l D n C k, so that bl < 0) is the left-hand side of the equation with mini-
      mum bi , and the entering variable is x0 , the extra added variable. We now show
