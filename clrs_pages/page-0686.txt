24.4 Difference constraints and shortest paths                                   665


can cast a given problem as a polynomial-sized linear-programming problem, then
we immediately have a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the problem. Second,
faster algorithms exist for many special cases of linear programming. For exam-
ple, the single-pair shortest-path problem (Exercise 24.4-4) and the maximum-ﬂow
problem (Exercise 26.1-5) are special cases of linear programming.
   Sometimes we don’t really care about the objective function; we just wish to ﬁnd
any feasible solution, that is, any vector x that satisﬁes Ax  b, or to determine
that no feasible solution exists. We shall focus on one such feasibility problem.

Systems of difference constraints
In a system of difference constraints, each row of the linear-programming matrix A
contains one 1 and one 1, and all other entries of A are 0. Thus, the constraints
given by Ax  b are a set of m difference constraints involving n unknowns, in
which each constraint is a simple linear inequality of the form
xj  xi  bk ;



                                ˘ˇ   ˘
where 1  i; j  n, i ¤ j , and 1  k  m.
  For example, consider the problem of ﬁnding a 5-vector x D .xi / that satisﬁes
     1 1  0  0  0                                    0
     1  0  0  0 1                                   1
                                         x1
     0  1  0  0 1                                    1
