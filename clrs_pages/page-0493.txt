           17-1 Bit-reversed binary counter
           Chapter 30 examines an important algorithm called the fast Fourier transform,
           or FFT. The ﬁrst step of the FFT algorithm performs a bit-reversal permutation on
           an input array AŒ0 : : n  1 whose length is n D 2k for some nonnegative integer k.
           This permutation swaps elements whose indices have binary representations that
           are the reverse of each other.
              We can express each index a as a k-bit sequence hak1 ; ak2 ; : : : ; a0 i, where
                Pk1
           a D i D0 ai 2i . We deﬁne
           revk .hak1 ; ak2 ; : : : ; a0 i/ D ha0 ; a1 ; : : : ; ak1 i I
           thus,
                         X
                         k1
           revk .a/ D           aki 1 2i :
                         i D0

           For example, if n D 16 (or, equivalently, k D 4), then revk .3/ D 12, since
           the 4-bit representation of 3 is 0011, which when reversed gives 1100, the 4-bit
           representation of 12.
           a. Given a function revk that runs in ‚.k/ time, write an algorithm to perform the
              bit-reversal permutation on an array of length n D 2k in O.nk/ time.
           We can use an algorithm based on an amortized analysis to improve the running
           time of the bit-reversal permutation. We maintain a “bit-reversed counter” and a
           procedure B IT-R EVERSED -I NCREMENT that, when given a bit-reversed-counter
           value a, produces revk .revk .a/ C 1/. If k D 4, for example, and the bit-reversed
           counter starts at 0, then successive calls to B IT-R EVERSED -I NCREMENT produce
           the sequence
           0000; 1000; 0100; 1100; 0010; 1010; : : : D 0; 8; 4; 12; 2; 10; : : : :
           b. Assume that the words in your computer store k-bit values and that in unit time,
              your computer can manipulate the binary values with operations such as shifting
              left or right by arbitrary amounts, bitwise-AND, bitwise-OR, etc. Describe
              an implementation of the B IT-R EVERSED -I NCREMENT procedure that allows
              the bit-reversal permutation on an n-element array to be performed in a total
              of O.n/ time.

           c. Suppose that you can shift a word left or right by only one bit in unit time. Is it
              still possible to implement an O.n/-time bit-reversal permutation?
