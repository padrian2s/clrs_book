                      Figure 13.1 A red-black tree with black nodes darkened and red nodes shaded. Every node in a
                      red-black tree is either red or black, the children of a red node are both black, and every simple path
                      from a node to a descendant leaf contains the same number of black nodes. (a) Every leaf, shown
                      as a NIL , is black. Each non-NIL node is marked with its black-height; NIL s have black-height 0.
                      (b) The same red-black tree but with each NIL replaced by the single sentinel T: nil, which is always
                      black, and with black-heights omitted. The root’s parent is also the sentinel. (c) The same red-black
                      tree but with leaves and the root’s parent omitted entirely. We shall use this drawing style in the
                      remainder of this chapter.
