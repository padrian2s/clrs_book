Problems for Chapter 15                                                           407


   As an example, one way to transform the source string algorithm to the target
string altruistic is to use the following sequence of operations, where the
underlined characters are xŒi and ´Œj  after the operation:
Operation            x                   ´
initial strings      algorithm
copy                 algorithm           a
copy                 algorithm           al
replace by t         algorithm           alt
delete               algorithm           alt
copy                 algorithm           altr
insert u             algorithm           altru
insert i             algorithm           altrui
insert s             algorithm           altruis
twiddle              algorithm           altruisti
insert c             algorithm           altruistic
kill                 algorithm           altruistic
Note that there are several other sequences of transformation operations that trans-
form algorithm to altruistic.
   Each of the transformation operations has an associated cost. The cost of an
operation depends on the speciﬁc application, but we assume that each operation’s
cost is a constant that is known to us. We also assume that the individual costs of
the copy and replace operations are less than the combined costs of the delete and
insert operations; otherwise, the copy and replace operations would not be used.
The cost of a given sequence of transformation operations is the sum of the costs
of the individual operations in the sequence. For the sequence above, the cost of
transforming algorithm to altruistic is
.3  cost.copy// C cost.replace/ C cost.delete/ C .4  cost.insert//
      C cost.twiddle/ C cost.kill/ :

a. Given two sequences xŒ1 : : m and yŒ1 : : n and set of transformation-operation
   costs, the edit distance from x to y is the cost of the least expensive operation
   sequence that transforms x to y. Describe a dynamic-programming algorithm
   that ﬁnds the edit distance from xŒ1 : : m to yŒ1 : : n and prints an optimal op-
   eration sequence. Analyze the running time and space requirements of your
   algorithm.

The edit-distance problem generalizes the problem of aligning two DNA sequences
(see, for example, Setubal and Meidanis [310, Section 3.2]). There are several
methods for measuring the similarity of two DNA sequences by aligning them.
One such method to align two sequences x and y consists of inserting spaces at
