   This pseudocode glosses over one subtle but important implementation detail.
How do we partition the matrices in line 5? If we were to create 12 new n=2 n=2
matrices, we would spend ‚.n2 / time copying entries. In fact, we can partition
the matrices without copying entries. The trick is to use index calculations. We
identify a submatrix by a range of row indices and a range of column indices of
the original matrix. We end up representing a submatrix a little differently from
how we represent the original matrix, which is the subtlety we are glossing over.
The advantage is that, since we can specify submatrices by index calculations,
executing line 5 takes only ‚.1/ time (although we shall see that it makes no
difference asymptotically to the overall running time whether we copy or partition
in place).
   Now, we derive a recurrence to characterize the running time of S QUARE -
M ATRIX -M ULTIPLY-R ECURSIVE. Let T .n/ be the time to multiply two n n
matrices using this procedure. In the base case, when n D 1, we perform just the
one scalar multiplication in line 4, and so
T .1/ D ‚.1/ :                                                                (4.15)
   The recursive case occurs when n > 1. As discussed, partitioning the matrices in
line 5 takes ‚.1/ time, using index calculations. In lines 6–9, we recursively call
S QUARE -M ATRIX -M ULTIPLY-R ECURSIVE a total of eight times. Because each
recursive call multiplies two n=2 n=2 matrices, thereby contributing T .n=2/ to
the overall running time, the time taken by all eight recursive calls is 8T .n=2/. We
also must account for the four matrix additions in lines 6–9. Each of these matrices
contains n2 =4 entries, and so each of the four matrix additions takes ‚.n2 / time.
Since the number of matrix additions is a constant, the total time spent adding ma-
