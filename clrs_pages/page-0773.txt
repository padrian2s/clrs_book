      Figure 26.9 Discharging a vertex y. It takes 15 iterations of the while loop of D ISCHARGE to push
      all the excess ﬂow from y. Only the neighbors of y and edges of the ﬂow network that enter or leave y
      are shown. In each part of the ﬁgure, the number inside each vertex is its excess at the beginning of
      the ﬁrst iteration shown in the part, and each vertex is shown at its height throughout the part. The
      neighbor list y: N at the beginning of each iteration appears on the right, with the iteration number
      on top. The shaded neighbor is y: current. (a) Initially, there are 19 units of excess to push from y,
      and y: current D s. Iterations 1, 2, and 3 just advance y: current, since there are no admissible edges
      leaving y. In iteration 4, y: current D NIL (shown by the shading being below the neighbor list),
      and so y is relabeled and y: current is reset to the head of the neighbor list. (b) After relabeling,
      vertex y has height 1. In iterations 5 and 6, edges .y; s/ and .y; x/ are found to be inadmissible, but
      iteration 7 pushes 8 units of excess ﬂow from y to ´. Because of the push, y: current does not advance
      in this iteration. (c) Because the push in iteration 7 saturated edge .y; ´/, it is found inadmissible in
      iteration 8. In iteration 9, y: current D NIL, and so vertex y is again relabeled and y: current is reset.
