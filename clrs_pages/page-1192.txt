Figure B.3 (a) A pair of isomorphic graphs. The vertices of the top graph are mapped to the
vertices of the bottom graph by f .1/ D u; f .2/ D ; f .3/ D w; f .4/ D x; f .5/ D y; f .6/ D ´.
(b) Two graphs that are not isomorphic, since the top graph has a vertex of degree 4 and the bottom
graph does not.


alence classes of vertices under the “are mutually reachable” relation. A directed
graph is strongly connected if it has only one strongly connected component. The
graph in Figure B.2(a) has three strongly connected components: f1; 2; 4; 5g, f3g,
and f6g. All pairs of vertices in f1; 2; 4; 5g are mutually reachable. The ver-
tices f3; 6g do not form a strongly connected component, since vertex 6 cannot
be reached from vertex 3.
   Two graphs G D .V; E/ and G 0 D .V 0 ; E 0 / are isomorphic if there exists a
bijection f W V ! V 0 such that .u; / 2 E if and only if .f .u/; f .// 2 E 0 .
In other words, we can relabel the vertices of G to be vertices of G 0 , maintain-
ing the corresponding edges in G and G 0 . Figure B.3(a) shows a pair of iso-
morphic graphs G and G 0 with respective vertex sets V D f1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6g and
V 0 D fu; ; w; x; y; ´g. The mapping from V to V 0 given by f .1/ D u; f .2/ D ;
f .3/ D w; f .4/ D x; f .5/ D y; f .6/ D ´ provides the required bijective func-
tion. The graphs in Figure B.3(b) are not isomorphic. Although both graphs have
5 vertices and 7 edges, the top graph has a vertex of degree 4 and the bottom graph
does not.
   We say that a graph G 0 D .V 0 ; E 0 / is a subgraph of G D .V; E/ if V 0  V
and E 0  E. Given a set V 0  V , the subgraph of G induced by V 0 is the graph
G 0 D .V 0 ; E 0 /, where
