11.4 Open addressing                                                               275


because we would be ﬁnding one of the remaining .n  .j  1// elements in one
of the .m  .j  1// unexamined slots, and by the assumption of uniform hashing,
the probability is the ratio of these quantities. Observing that n < m implies that
.n  j /=.m  j /  n=m for all j such that 0  j < m, we have for all i such that
1  i  m,

Now, we use equation (C.25) to bound the expected number of probes:

            1
E ŒX  D            Pr fX  ig
            i D1
            X 1
                   ˛ i 1
            i D1
            X 1
        D           ˛i
             i D0
              1
        D        :
             1˛

   This bound of 1=.1  ˛/ D 1 C ˛ C ˛ 2 C ˛ 3 C    has an intuitive interpretation.
We always make the ﬁrst probe. With probability approximately ˛, the ﬁrst probe
ﬁnds an occupied slot, so that we need to probe a second time. With probability
approximately ˛ 2 , the ﬁrst two slots are occupied so that we make a third probe,
and so on.
   If ˛ is a constant, Theorem 11.6 predicts that an unsuccessful search runs in O.1/
time. For example, if the hash table is half full, the average number of probes in an
unsuccessful search is at most 1=.1  :5/ D 2. If it is 90 percent full, the average
number of probes is at most 1=.1  :9/ D 10.
   Theorem 11.6 gives us the performance of the H ASH -I NSERT procedure almost
immediately.

Corollary 11.7
Inserting an element into an open-address hash table with load factor ˛ requires at
most 1=.1  ˛/ probes on average, assuming uniform hashing.
