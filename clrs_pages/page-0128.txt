Problems

           4-1 Recurrence examples
           Give asymptotic upper and lower bounds for T .n/ in each of the following recur-
           rences. Assume that T .n/ is constant for n  2. Make your bounds as tight as
           possible, and justify your answers.

           a. T .n/ D 2T .n=2/ C n4 .

           b. T .n/ D T .7n=10/ C n.

           c. T .n/ D 16T .n=4/ C n2 .

           d. T .n/ D 7T .n=3/ C n2 .

           e. T .n/ D 7T .n=2/ C n2 .
                                 p
           f. T .n/ D 2T .n=4/ C n.

           4-2 Parameter-passing costs
           Throughout this book, we assume that parameter passing during procedure calls
           takes constant time, even if an N -element array is being passed. This assumption
           is valid in most systems because a pointer to the array is passed, not the array itself.
           This problem examines the implications of three parameter-passing strategies:
           1. An array is passed by pointer. Time D ‚.1/.
           2. An array is passed by copying. Time D ‚.N /, where N is the size of the array.
           3. An array is passed by copying only the subrange that might be accessed by the
              called procedure. Time D ‚.q  p C 1/ if the subarray AŒp : : q is passed.

           a. Consider the recursive binary search algorithm for ﬁnding a number in a sorted
              array (see Exercise 2.3-5). Give recurrences for the worst-case running times
              of binary search when arrays are passed using each of the three methods above,
              and give good upper bounds on the solutions of the recurrences. Let N be the
              size of the original problem and n be the size of a subproblem.

           b. Redo part (a) for the M ERGE -S ORT algorithm from Section 2.3.1.
