         How many balls fall in a given bin? The number of balls that fall in a given bin
      follows the binomial distribution b.kI n; 1=b/. If we toss n balls, equation (C.37)
      tells us that the expected number of balls that fall in the given bin is n=b.
         How many balls must we toss, on the average, until a given bin contains a ball?
      The number of tosses until the given bin receives a ball follows the geometric
      distribution with probability 1=b and, by equation (C.32), the expected number of
      tosses until success is 1=.1=b/ D b.
         How many balls must we toss until every bin contains at least one ball? Let us
      call a toss in which a ball falls into an empty bin a “hit.” We want to know the
      expected number n of tosses required to get b hits.
         Using the hits, we can partition the n tosses into stages. The ith stage consists of
      the tosses after the .i  1/st hit until the ith hit. The ﬁrst stage consists of the ﬁrst
      toss, since we are guaranteed to have a hit when all bins are empty. For each toss
      during the ith stage, i  1 bins contain balls and b  i C 1 bins are empty. Thus,
      for each toss in the ith stage, the probability of obtaining a hit is .b  i C 1/=b.
         Let ni denote the number of tosses in the ith stage. Thus, the number of tosses
                                       Pb
      required to get b hits is n D i D1 ni . Each random variable ni has a geometric
      distribution with probability of success .b  i C 1/=b and thus, by equation (C.32),
      we have

      By linearity of expectation, we have

      It therefore takes approximately b ln b tosses before we can expect that every bin
      has a ball. This problem is also known as the coupon collector’s problem, which
      says that a person trying to collect each of b different coupons expects to acquire
      approximately b ln b randomly obtained coupons in order to succeed.
