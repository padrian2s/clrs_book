         Figure 25.5 shows the matrices T .k/ computed by the T RANSITIVE -C LOSURE
      procedure on a sample graph. The T RANSITIVE -C LOSURE procedure, like the
      Floyd-Warshall algorithm, runs in ‚.n3 / time. On some computers, though, log-
      ical operations on single-bit values execute faster than arithmetic operations on
      integer words of data. Moreover, because the direct transitive-closure algorithm
      uses only boolean values rather than integer values, its space requirement is less
