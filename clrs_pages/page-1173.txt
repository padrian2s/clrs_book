1152   Appendix A    Summations


          A common bug in applying this method is to show that the ratio of consecu-
       tive terms is less than 1 and then to assume that the summation is bounded by a
       geometric series. An example is the inﬁnite harmonic series, which diverges since
       X
       1
         1                  X
                            n
                              1
                 D    lim
             k        n!1         k
       kD1                  kD1
                 D lim ‚.lg n/
                   n!1
                 D 1:
       The ratio of the .k C1/st and kth terms in this series is k=.k C1/ < 1, but the series
       is not bounded by a decreasing geometric series. To bound a series by a geometric
       series, we must show that there is an r < 1, which is a constant, such that the ratio
       of all pairs of consecutive terms never exceeds r. In the harmonic series, no such r
       exists because the ratio becomes arbitrarily close to 1.

       Splitting summations
       One way to obtain bounds on a difﬁcult summation is to express the series as the
       sum of two or more series by partitioning the range of the index and then to bound
       each of the resulting series.
                                 Pn For example, suppose we try to ﬁnd a lower bound
       on the arithmetic series kD1 k, which we have already seen has an upper bound
       of n2 . We might attempt to bound each term in the summation by the smallest term,
       but since that term is 1, we get a lower bound of n for the summation—far off from
       our upper bound of n2 .
          We can obtain a better lower bound by ﬁrst splitting the summation. Assume for
       convenience that n is even. We have
       X
       n             X
                     n=2
                                  X
                                  n
             k D           kC             k
       kD1           kD1        kDn=2C1

                     X
                     n=2
                                  X
                                  n
                          0C         .n=2/
                     kD1        kDn=2C1

       which is an asymptotically tight bound, since kD1 k D O.n2 /.
          For a summation arising from the analysis of an algorithm, we can often split
       the summation and ignore a constant number of the P initial terms. Generally, this
                                                             n
       technique applies when each term ak in a summation kD0 ak is independent of n.
