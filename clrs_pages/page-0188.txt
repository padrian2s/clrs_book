Problems for Chapter 6                                                           167


B UILD -M AX -H EAP0 .A/
1 A:heap-size D 1
2 for i D 2 to A:length
3       M AX -H EAP -I NSERT .A; AŒi/

a. Do the procedures B UILD -M AX -H EAP and B UILD -M AX -H EAP 0 always create
   the same heap when run on the same input array? Prove that they do, or provide
   a counterexample.

b. Show that in the worst case, B UILD -M AX -H EAP 0 requires ‚.n lg n/ time to
   build an n-element heap.

6-2 Analysis of d -ary heaps
A d -ary heap is like a binary heap, but (with one possible exception) non-leaf
nodes have d children instead of 2 children.

a. How would you represent a d -ary heap in an array?

b. What is the height of a d -ary heap of n elements in terms of n and d ?

c. Give an efﬁcient implementation of E XTRACT-M AX in a d -ary max-heap. An-
   alyze its running time in terms of d and n.

d. Give an efﬁcient implementation of I NSERT in a d -ary max-heap. Analyze its
   running time in terms of d and n.

e. Give an efﬁcient implementation of I NCREASE -K EY .A; i; k/, which ﬂags an
   error if k < AŒi, but otherwise sets AŒi D k and then updates the d -ary max-
   heap structure appropriately. Analyze its running time in terms of d and n.

6-3 Young tableaus
An m n Young tableau is an m n matrix such that the entries of each row are
in sorted order from left to right and the entries of each column are in sorted order
from top to bottom. Some of the entries of a Young tableau may be 1, which we
treat as nonexistent elements. Thus, a Young tableau can be used to hold r  mn
ﬁnite numbers.

a. Draw a 4 4 Young tableau containing the elements f9; 16; 3; 2; 4; 8; 5; 14; 12g.

b. Argue that an m n Young tableau Y is empty if Y Œ1; 1 D 1. Argue that Y
   is full (contains mn elements) if Y Œm; n < 1.
