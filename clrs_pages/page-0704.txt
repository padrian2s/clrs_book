stra’s algorithm, since the sequence of values returned by E XTRACT-M IN calls
does not monotonically increase over time.
   For graphs with negative

janp[122] runs in O. V E lg.V W // time, and one by Goldberg [137] runs in
O. V E lg W / time, where W D max.u;/2E fjw.u; /jg.
   Cherkassky, Goldberg, and Radzik [64] conducted extensive experiments com-
paring various shortest-path algorithms.
