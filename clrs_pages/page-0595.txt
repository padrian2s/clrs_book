      which is the estimated number of atoms in the observable universe. (The symbol
      “ ” denotes the “much-greater-than” relation.)
        We deﬁne the inverse of the function Ak .n/, for integer n  0, by
      ˛.n/ D min fk W Ak .1/  ng :



               ˚
      In words, ˛.n/ is the lowest level k for which Ak .1/ is at least n. From the above
      values of Ak .1/, we see that

                   0     for 0  n  2 ;
                   1     for n D 3 ;
      ˛.n/ D       2     for 4  n  7 ;
                   3     for 8  n  2047 ;
                   4     for 2048  n  A4 .1/ :
      It is only for values of n so large that the term “astronomical” understates them
      (greater than A4 .1/, a huge number) that ˛.n/ > 4, and so ˛.n/  4 for all
      practical purposes.
