306   Chapter 12 Binary Search Trees


      At each recursive invocation of quicksort, we choose a random pivot element to
      partition the set of elements being sorted. Each node of a binary search tree parti-
      tions the set of elements that fall into the subtree rooted at that node.

      f. Describe an implementation of quicksort in which the comparisons to sort a set
         of elements are exactly the same as the comparisons to insert the elements into
         a binary search tree. (The order in which comparisons are made may differ, but
         the same comparisons must occur.)

      12-4 Number of different binary trees
      Let bn denote the number of different binary trees with n nodes. In this problem,
      you will ﬁnd a formula for bn , as well as an asymptotic estimate.

      a. Show that b0 D 1 and that, for n  1,

                X
                n1
         bn D         bk bn1k :
                kD0


      b. Referring to Problem 4-4 for the deﬁnition of a generating function, let B.x/
         be the generating function

                   X
                   1
         B.x/ D             bn x n :
                      nD0


         Show that B.x/ D xB.x/2 C 1, and hence one way to express B.x/ in closed
         form is
                       1    p
         B.x/ D          1  1  4x :
                      2x
      The Taylor expansion of f .x/ around the point x D a is given by
                X
                1
                  f .k/ .a/
      f .x/ D                     .x  a/k ;
                        kŠ
                kD0

      where f .k/ .x/ is the kth derivative of f evaluated at x.

      c. Show that
                                 !
               1  2n
         bn D
              nC1 n
