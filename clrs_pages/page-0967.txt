            Proof Lagrange’s theorem (Theorem 31.15) implies that ord.a/ j jSj, and so
            jSj  0 .mod t/, where t D ord.a/. Therefore, a.jSj/ D a.0/ D e.

31.4 Solving modular linear equations

            We now consider the problem of ﬁnding solutions to the equation
            ax  b .mod n/ ;                                                            (31.25)
            where a > 0 and n > 0. This problem has several applications; for example,
            we shall use it as part of the procedure for ﬁnding keys in the RSA public-key
            cryptosystem in Section 31.7. We assume that a, b, and n are given, and we wish
            to ﬁnd all values of x, modulo n, that satisfy equation (31.25). The equation may
            have zero, one, or more than one such solution.
               Let hai denote the subgroup of Zn generated by a. Since hai D fa.x/ W x > 0g D
            fax mod n W x > 0g, equation (31.25) has a solution if and only if Œb 2 hai. La-
            grange’s theorem (Theorem 31.15) tells us that jhaij must be a divisor of n. The
            following theorem gives us a precise characterization of hai.
