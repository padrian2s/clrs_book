11.1 Direct-address tables

            Direct addressing is a simple technique that works well when the universe U of
            keys is reasonably small. Suppose that an application needs a dynamic set in which
            each element has a key drawn from the universe U D f0; 1; : : : ; m  1g, where m
            is not too large. We shall assume that no two elements have the same key.
               To represent the dynamic set, we use an array, or direct-address table, denoted
            by T Œ0 : : m  1, in which each position, or slot, corresponds to a key in the uni-
            verse U . Figure 11.1 illustrates the approach; slot k points to an element in the set
            with key k. If the set contains no element with key k, then T Œk D NIL.
               The dictionary operations are trivial to implement:

            D IRECT-A DDRESS -S EARCH .T; k/
            1 return T Œk

            D IRECT-A DDRESS -I NSERT .T; x/
            1 T Œx:key D x

            D IRECT-A DDRESS -D ELETE .T; x/
            1 T Œx:key D NIL

            Each of these operations takes only O.1/ time.

            Figure 11.1 How to implement a dynamic set by a direct-address table T . Each key in the universe
            U D f0; 1; : : : ; 9g corresponds to an index in the table. The set K D f2; 3; 5; 8g of actual keys
            determines the slots in the table that contain pointers to elements. The other slots, heavily shaded,
            contain NIL .
