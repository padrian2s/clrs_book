35.3 The set-covering problem                                                   1119


A greedy approximation algorithm
The greedy method works by picking, at each stage, the set S that covers the great-
est number of remaining elements that are uncovered.

In the example of Figure 35.3, G REEDY-S ET-C OVER adds to C , in order, the sets
S1 , S4 , and S5 , followed by either S3 or S6 .
   The algorithm works as follows. The set U contains, at each stage, the set of
remaining uncovered elements. The set C contains the cover being constructed.
Line 4 is the greedy decision-making step, choosing a subset S that covers as many
uncovered elements as possible (breaking ties arbitrarily). After S is selected,
line 5 removes its elements from U , and line 6 places S into C . When the algorithm
terminates, the set C contains a subfamily of F that covers X .
   We can easily implement G REEDY-S ET-C OVER to run in time polynomial in jX j
and jF j. Since the number of iterations of the loop on lines 3–6 is bounded from
above by min.jX j ; jF j/, and we can implement the loop body to run in time
O.jX j jF j/, a simple implementation runs in time O.jX j jF j min.jX j ; jF j//. Ex-
ercise 35.3-3 asks for a linear-time algorithm.

Analysis
We now show that the greedy algorithm returns a set cover that is not too much
larger than an optimal set cover. For convenience, in this chapter we denote the d th

harmonic number Hd D i D1 1=i (see Section A.1) by H.d /. As a boundary
condition, we deﬁne H.0/ D 0.
