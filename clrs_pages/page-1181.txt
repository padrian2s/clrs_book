           Figure B.1 illustrates the ﬁrst of DeMorgan’s laws, using a Venn diagram: a graph-
           ical picture in which sets are represented as regions of the plane.
              Often, all the sets under consideration are subsets of some larger set U called the
           universe. For example, if we are considering various sets made up only of integers,
           the set Z of integers is an appropriate universe. Given a universe U , we deﬁne the
           complement of a set A as A D U  A D fx W x 2 U and x 62 Ag. For any set
           A  U , we have the following laws:

             A D A;
           A\A D ;;
           A[A D U :
