13.4 Deletion                                                                             327


   Within the while loop, x always points to a nonroot doubly black node. We
determine in line 2 whether x is a left child or a right child of its parent x:p. (We
have given the code for the situation in which x is a left child; the situation in
which x is a right child—line 22—is symmetric.) We maintain a pointer w to
the sibling of x. Since node x is doubly black, node w cannot be T:nil, because
otherwise, the number of blacks on the simple path from x:p to the (singly black)
leaf w would be smaller than the number on the simple path from x:p to x.
   The four cases2 in the code appear in Figure 13.7. Before examining each case
in detail, let’s look more generally at how we can verify that the transformation
in each of the cases preserves property 5. The key idea is that in each case, the
transformation applied preserves the number of black nodes (including x’s extra
black) from (and including) the root of the subtree shown to each of the subtrees
˛; ˇ; : : : ; . Thus, if property 5 holds prior to the transformation, it continues to
hold afterward. For example, in Figure 13.7(a), which illustrates case 1, the num-
ber of black nodes from the root to either subtree ˛ or ˇ is 3, both before and after
the transformation. (Again, remember that node x adds an extra black.) Similarly,
the number of black nodes from the root to any of , ı, ", and is 2, both be-
fore and after the transformation. In Figure 13.7(b), the counting must involve the
value c of the color attribute of the root of the subtree shown, which can be either
RED or BLACK . If we deﬁne count.RED / D 0 and count.BLACK / D 1, then the
number of black nodes from the root to ˛ is 2 C count.c/, both before and after
the transformation. In this case, after the transformation, the new node x has color
attribute c, but this node is really either red-and-black (if c D RED ) or doubly black
(if c D BLACK ). You can verify the other cases similarly (see Exercise 13.4-5).

Case 1: x’s sibling w is red
Case 1 (lines 5–8 of RB-D ELETE -F IXUP and Figure 13.7(a)) occurs when node w,
the sibling of node x, is red. Since w must have black children, we can switch the
colors of w and x:p and then perform a left-rotation on x:p without violating any
of the red-black properties. The new sibling of x, which is one of w’s children
prior to the rotation, is now black, and thus we have converted case 1 into case 2,
3, or 4.
  Cases 2, 3, and 4 occur when node w is black; they are distinguished by the
colors of w’s children.


2 As in RB-I NSERT-F IXUP , the cases in RB-D ELETE -F IXUP are not mutually exclusive.
