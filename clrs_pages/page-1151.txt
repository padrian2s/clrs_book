       that if two values in L are close to each other, then since we want just an approxi-
       mate solution, we do not need to maintain both of them explicitly. More precisely,
       we use a trimming parameter ı such that 0 < ı < 1. When we trim a list L by ı,
       we remove as many elements from L as possible, in such a way that if L0 is the
       result of trimming L, then for every element y that was removed from L, there is
       an element ´ still in L0 that approximates y, that is,
          y
               ´y:                                                                (35.24)

       We can think of such a ´ as “representing” y in the new list L0 . Each removed
       element y is represented by a remaining element ´ satisfying inequality (35.24).
       For example, if ı D 0:1 and
       L D h10; 11; 12; 15; 20; 21; 22; 23; 24; 29i ;
       then we can trim L to obtain
       L0 D h10; 12; 15; 20; 23; 29i ;
       where the deleted value 11 is represented by 10, the deleted values 21 and 22
       are represented by 20, and the deleted value 24 is represented by 23. Because
       every element of the trimmed version of the list is also an element of the original
       version of the list, trimming can dramatically decrease the number of elements kept
       while keeping a close (and slightly smaller) representative value in the list for each
       deleted element.
          The following procedure trims list L D hy1 ; y2 ; : : : ; ym i in time ‚.m/, given L
       and ı, and assuming that L is sorted into monotonically increasing order. The
       output of the procedure is a trimmed, sorted list.
       T RIM .L; ı/
       1 let m be the length of L
       2 L0 D hy1 i
       3 last D y1
       4 for i D 2 to m
       5       if yi > last  .1 C ı/     // yi  last because L is sorted
       6            append yi onto the end of L0
       7            last D yi
       8 return L0
       The procedure scans the elements of L in monotonically increasing order. A num-
       ber is appended onto the returned list L0 only if it is the ﬁrst element of L or if it
       cannot be represented by the most recent number placed into L0 .
         Given the procedure T RIM, we can construct our approximation scheme as fol-
       lows. This procedure takes as input a set S D fx1 ; x2 ; : : : ; xn g of n integers (in
       arbitrary order), a target integer t, and an “approximation parameter” , where
