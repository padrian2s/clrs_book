OS-S ELECT .x; i/
1 r D x:left:size C 1
2 if i == r

4 elseif i < r
5      return OS-S ELECT .x:left; i/
6 else return OS-S ELECT .x:right; i  r/

   In line 1 of OS-S ELECT, we compute r, the rank of node x within the subtree
rooted at x. The value of x:left:size is the number of nodes that come before x
in an inorder tree walk of the subtree rooted at x. Thus, x:left:size C 1 is the
rank of x within the subtree rooted at x. If i D r, then node x is the ith smallest
element, and so we return x in line 3. If i < r, then the ith smallest element
resides in x’s left subtree, and so we recurse on x:left in line 5. If i > r, then
the ith smallest element resides in x’s right subtree. Since the subtree rooted at x
contains r elements that come before x’s right subtree in an inorder tree walk, the
ith smallest element in the subtree rooted at x is the .i  r/th smallest element in
the subtree rooted at x:right. Line 6 determines this element recursively.
   To see how OS-S ELECT operates, consider a search for the 17th smallest ele-
ment in the order-statistic tree of Figure 14.1. We begin with x as the root, whose
key is 26, and with i D 17. Since the size of 26’s left subtree is 12, its rank is 13.
Thus, we know that the node with rank 17 is the 17  13 D 4th smallest element
in 26’s right subtree. After the recursive call, x is the node with key 41, and i D 4.
Since the size of 41’s left subtree is 5, its rank within its subtree is 6. Thus, we
know that the node with rank 4 is the 4th smallest element in 41’s left subtree. Af-
ter the recursive call, x is the node with key 30, and its rank within its subtree is 2.
Thus, we recurse once again to ﬁnd the 4 2 D 2nd smallest element in the subtree
rooted at the node with key 38. We now ﬁnd that its left subtree has size 1, which
means it is the second smallest element. Thus, the procedure returns a pointer to
the node with key 38.
   Because each recursive call goes down one level in the order-statistic tree, the
total time for OS-S ELECT is at worst proportional to the height of the tree. Since
the tree is a red-black tree, its height is O.lg n/, where n is the number of nodes.
Thus, the running time of OS-S ELECT is O.lg n/ for a dynamic set of n elements.

Determining the rank of an element
Given a pointer to a node x in an order-statistic tree T , the procedure OS-R ANK
returns the position of x in the linear order determined by an inorder tree walk
of T .
