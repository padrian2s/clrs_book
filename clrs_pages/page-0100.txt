4.2 Strassen’s algorithm for matrix multiplication                                   79


the factor of 8 in equation (4.16) or the factor of 2 in recurrence (4.1), the recursion
tree would just be linear, rather than “bushy,” and each level would contribute only
one term to the sum.
   Bear in mind, therefore, that although asymptotic notation subsumes constant
multiplicative factors, recursive notation such as T .n=2/ does not.

Strassen’s method
The key to Strassen’s method is to make the recursion tree slightly less bushy. That
is, instead of performing eight recursive multiplications of n=2 n=2 matrices,
it performs only seven. The cost of eliminating one matrix multiplication will be
several new additions of n=2 n=2 matrices, but still only a constant number of
additions. As before, the constant number of matrix additions will be subsumed
by ‚-notation when we set up the recurrence equation to characterize the running
time.
   Strassen’s method is not at all obvious. (This might be the biggest understate-
ment in this book.) It has four steps:
1. Divide the input matrices A and B and output matrix C into n=2 n=2 subma-
   trices, as in equation (4.9). This step takes ‚.1/ time by index calculation, just
   as in S QUARE -M ATRIX -M ULTIPLY-R ECURSIVE.
2. Create 10 matrices S1 ; S2 ; : : : ; S10 , each of which is n=2 n=2 and is the sum
   or difference of two matrices created in step 1. We can create all 10 matrices in
   ‚.n2 / time.
3. Using the submatrices created in step 1 and the 10 matrices created in step 2,
   recursively compute seven matrix products P1 ; P2 ; : : : ; P7 . Each matrix Pi is
   n=2 n=2.
4. Compute the desired submatrices C11 ; C12 ; C21 ; C22 of the result matrix C by
   adding and subtracting various combinations of the Pi matrices. We can com-
   pute all four submatrices in ‚.n2 / time.
   We shall see the details of steps 2–4 in a moment, but we already have enough
information to set up a recurrence for the running time of Strassen’s method. Let us
assume that once the matrix size n gets down to 1, we perform a simple scalar mul-
tiplication, just as in line 4 of S QUARE -M ATRIX -M ULTIPLY-R ECURSIVE. When
n > 1, steps 1, 2, and 4 take a total of ‚.n2 / time, and step 3 requires us to per-
form seven multiplications of n=2 n=2 matrices. Hence, we obtain the following
recurrence for the running time T .n/ of Strassen’s algorithm:
          (
            ‚.1/                   if n D 1 ;
T .n/ D                       2
                                                                              (4.18)
