indices into A, b, and c are not necessarily sets of contiguous integers; they depend
on the index sets B and N . As an example of the entries of A being the negatives
of the coefﬁcients as they appear in the slack form, observe that the equation for x1
includes the term x3 =6, yet the coefﬁcient a13 is actually 1=6 rather than C1=6.
