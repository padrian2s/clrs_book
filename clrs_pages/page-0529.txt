      Figure 19.2 (a) A Fibonacci heap consisting of ﬁve min-heap-ordered trees and 14 nodes. The
      dashed line indicates the root list. The minimum node of the heap is the node containing the key 3.
      Black nodes are marked. The potential of this particular Fibonacci heap is 5 C 2  3 D 11. (b) A more
      complete representation showing pointers p (up arrows), child (down arrows), and left and right
      (sideways arrows). The remaining ﬁgures in this chapter omit these details, since all the information
      shown here can be determined from what appears in part (a).


         Circular, doubly linked lists (see Section 10.2) have two advantages for use in
      Fibonacci heaps. First, we can insert a node into any location or remove a node
      from anywhere in a circular, doubly linked list in O.1/ time. Second, given two
      such lists, we can concatenate them (or “splice” them together) into one circular,
      doubly linked list in O.1/ time. In the descriptions of Fibonacci heap operations,
      we shall refer to these operations informally, letting you ﬁll in the details of their
      implementations if you wish.
         Each node has two other attributes. We store the number of children in the child
      list of node x in x:degree. The boolean-valued attribute x:mark indicates whether
      node x has lost a child since the last time x was made the child of another node.
      Newly created nodes are unmarked, and a node x becomes unmarked whenever it
      is made the child of another node. Until we look at the D ECREASE -K EY operation
      in Section 19.3, we will just set all mark attributes to FALSE.
         We access a given Fibonacci heap H by a pointer H:min to the root of a tree
      containing the minimum key; we call this node the minimum node of the Fibonacci
