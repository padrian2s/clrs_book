      Figure 18.7 Inserting keys into a B-tree. The minimum degree t for this B-tree is 3, so a node can
      hold at most 5 keys. Nodes that are modiﬁed by the insertion process are lightly shaded. (a) The
      initial tree for this example. (b) The result of inserting B into the initial tree; this is a simple insertion
      into a leaf node. (c) The result of inserting Q into the previous tree. The node RST U V splits into
      two nodes containing RS and U V , the key T moves up to the root, and Q is inserted in the leftmost
      of the two halves (the RS node). (d) The result of inserting L into the previous tree. The root
      splits right away, since it is full, and the B-tree grows in height by one. Then L is inserted into the
      leaf containing JK. (e) The result of inserting F into the previous tree. The node ABCDE splits
      before F is inserted into the rightmost of the two halves (the DE node).
