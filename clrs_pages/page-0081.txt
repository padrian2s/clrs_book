     which is to say that the ith Fibonacci number Fi is equal to  i = 5 rounded to the
     nearest integer. Thus, Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially.

     Exercises

     3.2-1
     Show that if f .n/ and g.n/ are monotonically increasing functions, then so are
     the functions f .n/ C g.n/ and f .g.n//, and if f .n/ and g.n/ are in addition
     nonnegative, then f .n/  g.n/ is monotonically increasing.
