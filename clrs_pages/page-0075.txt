     Floors and ceilings
     For any real number x, we denote the greatest integer less than or equal to x by bxc
     (read “the ﬂoor of x”) and the least integer greater than or equal to x by dxe (read
     “the ceiling of x”). For all real x,
     x  1 < bxc  x  dxe < x C 1 :                                                  (3.3)
     For any integer n,
     dn=2e C bn=2c D n ;
     and for any real number x  0 and integers a; b > 0,

            b              b
     The ﬂoor function f .x/ D bxc is monotonically increasing, as is the ceiling func-
     tion f .x/ D dxe.

     Modular arithmetic
     For any integer a and any positive integer n, the value a mod n is the remainder
     (or residue) of the quotient a=n:
     a mod n D a  n ba=nc :                                                          (3.8)
     It follows that
     0  a mod n < n :                                                                (3.9)
        Given a well-deﬁned notion of the remainder of one integer when divided by an-
     other, it is convenient to provide special notation to indicate equality of remainders.
     If .a mod n/ D .b mod n/, we write a  b .mod n/ and say that a is equivalent
     to b, modulo n. In other words, a  b .mod n/ if a and b have the same remain-
     der when divided by n. Equivalently, a  b .mod n/ if and only if n is a divisor
     of b  a. We write a 6 b .mod n/ if a is not equivalent to b, modulo n.
