5.4 Probabilistic analysis and further uses of indicator random variables          141


Pr fSi g D Pr fBi \ Oi g D Pr fBi g Pr fOi g :
The probability Pr fBi g is clearly 1=n, since the maximum is equally likely to
be in any one of the n positions. For event Oi to occur, the maximum value in
positions 1 through i 1, which is equally likely to be in any of these i 1 positions,
must be in one of the ﬁrst k positions. Consequently, Pr fOi g D k=.i  1/ and
Pr fSi g D k=.n.i  1//. Using equation (5.12), we have
                X
                n
Pr fSg D                  Pr fSi g
               i DkC1
                 Xn
                         k
          D
               i DkC1
                      n.i  1/

               k X 1
                      n
          D
               n  i 1
                  i DkC1

               kX1
                  n1
          D        :
               n i
                  i Dk


We approximate by integrals to bound this summation from above and below. By
the inequalities (A.12), we have
Z n           X
              n1     Z n1
     1            1          1
       dx                    dx :
  k x             i
               i Dk     k1 x

Evaluating these deﬁnite integrals gives us the bounds
k                         k
  .ln n  ln k/  Pr fSg  .ln.n  1/  ln.k  1// ;
n                         n
which provide a rather tight bound for Pr fSg. Because we wish to maximize our
probability of success, let us focus on choosing the value of k that maximizes the
lower bound on Pr fSg. (Besides, the lower-bound expression is easier to maximize
than the upper-bound expression.) Differentiating the expression .k=n/.ln nln k/
with respect to k, we obtain
1
   .ln n  ln k  1/ :
n
Setting this derivative equal to 0, we see that we maximize the lower bound on the
probability when ln k D ln n  1 D ln.n=e/ or, equivalently, when k D n=e. Thus,
if we implement our strategy with k D n=e, we succeed in hiring our best-qualiﬁed
applicant with probability at least 1=e.
