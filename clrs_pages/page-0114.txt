            is a constant, is .n lg n/ by appealing to a recursion tree.

            Draw the recursion tree for T .n/ D 4T .bn=2c/ C cn, where c is a constant, and
            provide a tight asymptotic bound on its solution. Verify your bound by the substi-
            tution method.

4.5 The master method for solving recurrences

            The master method provides a “cookbook” method for solving recurrences of the
            form
            T .n/ D aT .n=b/ C f .n/ ;                                                  (4.20)
            where a  1 and b > 1 are constants and f .n/ is an asymptotically positive
            function. To use the master method, you will need to memorize three cases, but
            then you will be able to solve many recurrences quite easily, often without pencil
            and paper.
