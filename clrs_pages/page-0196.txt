sort. If the partitioning is unbalanced, however, it can run asymptotically as slowly
as insertion sort. In this section, we shall informally investigate how quicksort
performs under the assumptions of balanced versus unbalanced partitioning.

Worst-case partitioning
The worst-case behavior for quicksort occurs when the partitioning routine pro-
duces one subproblem with n  1 elements and one with 0 elements. (We prove
this claim in Section 7.4.1.) Let us assume that this unbalanced partitioning arises
in each recursive call. The partitioning costs ‚.n/ time. Since the recursive call
on an array of size 0 just returns, T .0/ D ‚.1/, and the recurrence for the running
time is
T .n/ D T .n  1/ C T .0/ C ‚.n/
      D T .n  1/ C ‚.n/ :
Intuitively, if we sum the costs incurred at each level of the recursion, we get
an arithmetic series (equation (A.2)), which evaluates to ‚.n2 /. Indeed, it is
straightforward to use the substitution method to prove that the recurrence T .n/ D
T .n  1/ C ‚.n/ has the solution T .n/ D ‚.n2 /. (See Exercise 7.2-1.)
   Thus, if the partitioning is maximally unbalanced at every recursive level of the
algorithm, the running time is ‚.n2 /. Therefore the worst-case running time of
quicksort is no better than that of insertion sort. Moreover, the ‚.n2 / running time
occurs when the input array is already completely sorted—a common situation in
which insertion sort runs in O.n/ time.

Best-case partitioning
In the most even possible split, PARTITION produces two subproblems, each of
size no more than n=2, since one is of size bn=2c and one of size dn=2e  1. In this
case, quicksort runs much faster. The recurrence for the running time is then
T .n/ D 2T .n=2/ C ‚.n/ ;
where we tolerate the sloppiness from ignoring the ﬂoor and ceiling and from sub-
tracting 1. By case 2 of the master theorem (Theorem 4.1), this recurrence has the
solution T .n/ D ‚.n lg n/. By equally balancing the two sides of the partition at
every level of the recursion, we get an asymptotically faster algorithm.

Balanced partitioning
The average-case running time of quicksort is much closer to the best case than to
the worst case, as the analyses in Section 7.4 will show. The key to understand-
