30.1 Representing polynomials                                                            901


Similarly, adding two polynomials represented by the coefﬁcient vectors a D
.a0 ; a1 ; : : : ; an1 / and b D .b0 ; b1 ; : : : ; bn1 / takes ‚.n/ time: we just produce
the coefﬁcient vector c D .c0 ; c1 ; : : : ; cn1 /, where cj D aj C bj for j D
0; 1; : : : ; n  1.
   Now, consider multiplying two degree-bound n polynomials A.x/ and B.x/ rep-
resented in coefﬁcient form. If we use the method described by equations (30.1)
and (30.2), multiplying polynomials takes time ‚.n2 /, since we must multiply
each coefﬁcient in the vector a by each coefﬁcient in the vector b. The operation
of multiplying polynomials in coefﬁcient form seems to be considerably more difﬁ-
cult than that of evaluating a polynomial or adding two polynomials. The resulting
coefﬁcient vector c, given by equation (30.2), is also called the convolution of the
input vectors a and b, denoted c D a ˝ b. Since multiplying polynomials and
computing convolutions are fundamental computational problems of considerable
practical importance, this chapter concentrates on efﬁcient algorithms for them.

Point-value representation
A point-value representation of a polynomial A.x/ of degree-bound n is a set of
n point-value pairs
f.x0 ; y0 /; .x1 ; y1 /; : : : ; .xn1 ; yn1 /g
such that all of the xk are distinct and
yk D A.xk /                                                                           (30.3)
for k D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1. A polynomial has many different point-value representa-
tions, since we can use any set of n distinct points x0 ; x1 ; : : : ; xn1 as a basis for
the representation.
   Computing a point-value representation for a polynomial given in coefﬁcient
form is in principle straightforward, since all we have to do is select n distinct
points x0 ; x1 ; : : : ; xn1 and then evaluate A.xk / for k D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1. With
Horner’s method, evaluating a polynomial at n points takes time ‚.n2 /. We shall
see later that if we choose the points xk cleverly, we can accelerate this computation
to run in time ‚.n lg n/.
   The inverse of evaluation—determining the coefﬁcient form of a polynomial
from a point-value representation—is interpolation. The following theorem shows
that interpolation is well deﬁned when the desired interpolating polynomial must
have a degree-bound equal to the given number of point-value pairs.

Theorem 30.1 (Uniqueness of an interpolating polynomial)
For any set f.x0 ; y0 /; .x1 ; y1 /; : : : ; .xn1 ; yn1 /g of n point-value pairs such that
all the xk values are distinct, there is a unique polynomial A.x/ of degree-bound n
such that yk D A.xk / for k D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1.
