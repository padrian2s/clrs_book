   operates on at most a constant number of 1-bit values.

30-2 Toeplitz matrices
A Toeplitz matrix is an n n matrix A D .aij / such that aij D ai 1;j 1 for
i D 2; 3; : : : ; n and j D 2; 3; : : : ; n.

a. Is the sum of two Toeplitz matrices necessarily Toeplitz? What about the prod-
   uct?

b. Describe how to represent a Toeplitz matrix so that you can add two n                          n
   Toeplitz matrices in O.n/ time.

c. Give an O.n lg n/-time algorithm for multiplying an n n Toeplitz matrix by a
   vector of length n. Use your representation from part (b).

d. Give an efﬁcient algorithm for multiplying two n n Toeplitz matrices. Analyze
   its running time.

30-3 Multidimensional fast Fourier transform
We can generalize the 1-dimensional discrete Fourier transform deﬁned by equa-
tion (30.8) to d dimensions. The input is a d -dimensional array A D .aj1 ;j2 ;:::;jd /
whose dimensions are n1 ; n2 ; : : : ; nd , where n1 n2    nd D n. We deﬁne the
d -dimensional discrete Fourier transform by the equation
                    X X
                    n1 1 n2 1
                                        X
                                        nd 1

a. Show that we can compute a d -dimensional DFT by computing 1-dimensional
   DFTs on each dimension in turn. That is, we ﬁrst compute n=n1 separate
   1-dimensional DFTs along dimension 1. Then, using the result of the DFTs
   along dimension 1 as the input, we compute n=n2 separate 1-dimensional DFTs
   along dimension 2. Using this result as the input, we compute n=n3 separate
   1-dimensional DFTs along dimension 3, and so on, through dimension d .

b. Show that the ordering of dimensions does not matter, so that we can compute
   a d -dimensional DFT by computing the 1-dimensional DFTs in any order of
   the d dimensions.
