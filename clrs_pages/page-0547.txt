526        Chapter 19 Fibonacci Heaps


           Corollary 19.5
           The maximum degree D.n/ of any node in an n-node Fibonacci heap is O.lg n/.
           Proof Let x be any node in an n-node Fibonacci heap, and let k D x:degree.
           By Lemma 19.4, we have n  size.x/   k . Taking base-˘ logarithms gives
           us k  log n. (In fact, because k is an integer, k  log n .) The maximum
           degree D.n/ of any node is thus O.lg n/.

           Exercises

           19.4-1
           Professor Pinocchio claims that the height of an n-node Fibonacci heap is O.lg n/.
           Show that the professor is mistaken by exhibiting, for any positive integer n, a
           sequence of Fibonacci-heap operations that creates a Fibonacci heap consisting of
           just one tree that is a linear chain of n nodes.

           19.4-2
           Suppose we generalize the cascading-cut rule to cut a node x from its parent as
           soon as it loses its kth child, for some integer constant k. (The rule in Section 19.3
           uses k D 2.) For what values of k is D.n/ D O.lg n/?



Problems

           19-1 Alternative implementation of deletion
           Professor Pisano has proposed the following variant of the F IB -H EAP -D ELETE
           procedure, claiming that it runs faster when the node being deleted is not the node
           pointed to by H:min.

           P ISANO -D ELETE .H; x/
           1 if x == H:min
           2       F IB -H EAP -E XTRACT-M IN .H /
           3 else y D x:p
           4       if y ¤ NIL
           5             C UT.H; x; y/
           6             C ASCADING -C UT .H; y/
           7       add x’s child list to the root list of H
           8       remove x from the root list of H
