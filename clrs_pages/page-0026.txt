1         The Role of Algorithms in Computing




          What are algorithms? Why is the study of algorithms worthwhile? What is the role
          of algorithms relative to other technologies used in computers? In this chapter, we
          will answer these questions.


1.1 Algorithms

          Informally, an algorithm is any well-deﬁned computational procedure that takes
          some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as
          output. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the
          input into the output.
             We can also view an algorithm as a tool for solving a well-speciﬁed computa-
          tional problem. The statement of the problem speciﬁes in general terms the desired
          input/output relationship. The algorithm describes a speciﬁc computational proce-
          dure for achieving that input/output relationship.
             For example, we might need to sort a sequence of numbers into nondecreasing
          order. This problem arises frequently in practice and provides fertile ground for
          introducing many standard design techniques and analysis tools. Here is how we
          formally deﬁne the sorting problem:
          Input: A sequence of n numbers ha1 ; a2 ; : : : ; an i.
          Output: A permutation (reordering) ha10 ; a20 ; : : : ; an0 i of the input sequence such
            that a10  a20      an0 .
          For example, given the input sequence h31; 41; 59; 26; 41; 58i, a sorting algorithm
          returns as output the sequence h26; 31; 41; 41; 58; 59i. Such an input sequence is
          called an instance of the sorting problem. In general, an instance of a problem
          consists of the input (satisfying whatever constraints are imposed in the problem
          statement) needed to compute a solution to the problem.
