74   Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer


     already seen, the call to F IND -M AX -C ROSSING -S UBARRAY in line 6 takes ‚.n/
     time. Lines 7–11 take only ‚.1/ time. For the recursive case, therefore, we have
     T .n/ D ‚.1/ C 2T .n=2/ C ‚.n/ C ‚.1/
           D 2T .n=2/ C ‚.n/ :                                                   (4.6)
        Combining equations (4.5) and (4.6) gives us a recurrence for the running
     time T .n/ of F IND -M AXIMUM -S UBARRAY:
              (
                ‚.1/             if n D 1 ;
     T .n/ D                                                                 (4.7)
                2T .n=2/ C ‚.n/ if n > 1 :
     This recurrence is the same as recurrence (4.1) for merge sort. As we shall
     see from the master method in Section 4.5, this recurrence has the solution
     T .n/ D ‚.n lg n/. You might also revisit the recursion tree in Figure 2.5 to un-
     derstand why the solution should be T .n/ D ‚.n lg n/.
        Thus, we see that the divide-and-conquer method yields an algorithm that is
     asymptotically faster than the brute-force method. With merge sort and now the
     maximum-subarray problem, we begin to get an idea of how powerful the divide-
     and-conquer method can be. Sometimes it will yield the asymptotically fastest
     algorithm for a problem, and other times we can do even better. As Exercise 4.1-5
     shows, there is in fact a linear-time algorithm for the maximum-subarray problem,
     and it does not use divide-and-conquer.

     Exercises

     4.1-1
     What does F IND -M AXIMUM -S UBARRAY return when all elements of A are nega-
     tive?

     4.1-2
     Write pseudocode for the brute-force method of solving the maximum-subarray
     problem. Your procedure should run in ‚.n2 / time.

     4.1-3
     Implement both the brute-force and recursive algorithms for the maximum-
     subarray problem on your own computer. What problem size n0 gives the crossover
     point at which the recursive algorithm beats the brute-force algorithm? Then,
     change the base case of the recursive algorithm to use the brute-force algorithm
     whenever the problem size is less than n0 . Does that change the crossover point?

     4.1-4
     Suppose we change the deﬁnition of the maximum-subarray problem to allow the
     result to be an empty subarray, where the sum of the values of an empty subar-
