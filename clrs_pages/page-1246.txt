D.2 Basic matrix properties                                                      1225


Theorem D.5
An n n matrix A is singular if and only if det.A/ D 0.

Positive-deﬁnite matrices
Positive-deﬁnite matrices play an important role in many applications. An n n
matrix A is positive-deﬁnite if x TAx > 0 for all n-vectors x ¤ 0. For
example, the identity matrix is positive-deﬁnite, since for any nonzero vector
x D . x 1 x 2    x n /T ,
x T In x D x T x
           Xn
         D      xi2
              i D1
         > 0:
   Matrices that arise in applications are often positive-deﬁnite due to the following
theorem.

Theorem D.6
For any matrix A with full column rank, the matrix AT A is positive-deﬁnite.

Proof We must show that x T .AT A/x > 0 for any nonzero vector x. For any
vector x,
x T .AT A/x D .Ax/T.Ax/ (by Exercise D.1-2)
            D kAxk2 :
Note that kAxk2 is just the sum of the squares of the elements of the vector Ax.
Therefore, kAxk2  0. If kAxk2 D 0, every element of Ax is 0, which is to say
Ax D 0. Since A has full column rank, Ax D 0 implies x D 0, by Theorem D.2.
Hence, AT A is positive-deﬁnite.

  Section 28.3 explores other properties of positive-deﬁnite matrices.

Exercises

D.2-1
Prove that matrix inverses are unique, that is, if B and C are inverses of A, then
B D C.

D.2-2
Prove that the determinant of a lower-triangular or upper-triangular matrix is equal
to the product of its diagonal elements. Prove that the inverse of a lower-triangular
matrix, if it exists, is lower-triangular.
