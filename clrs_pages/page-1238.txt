D          Matrices




           Matrices arise in numerous applications, including, but by no means limited to,
           scientiﬁc computing. If you have seen matrices before, much of the material in this
           appendix will be familiar to you, but some of it might be new. Section D.1 covers
           basic matrix deﬁnitions and operations, and Section D.2 presents some basic matrix
           properties.


D.1 Matrices and matrix operations

           In this section, we review some basic concepts of matrix theory and some funda-
           mental properties of matrices.

           Matrices and vectors
           A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. For example,
                                    
                     a11 a12 a13
           A D
                     a21 a22 a23
                              
                     1 2 3
              D                                                                         (D.1)
                     4 5 6
           is a 2 3 matrix A D .aij /, where for i D 1; 2 and j D 1; 2; 3, we denote the
           element of the matrix in row i and column j by aij . We use uppercase letters
           to denote matrices and corresponding subscripted lowercase letters to denote their
           elements. We denote the set of all m n matrices with real-valued entries by Rmn
           and, in general, the set of m n matrices with entries drawn from a set S by S mn .
              The transpose of a matrix A is the matrix AT obtained by exchanging the rows
           and columns of A. For the matrix A of equation (D.1),
