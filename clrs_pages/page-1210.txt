           Use induction on all integers k such that 0  k  n=2 to prove inequality (C.6),
           and use equation (C.3) to extend it to all integers k such that 0  k  n.

C.2 Probability

           Probability is an essential tool for the design and analysis of probabilistic and ran-
           domized algorithms. This section reviews basic probability theory.
              We deﬁne probability in terms of a sample space S, which is a set whose ele-
           ments are called elementary events. We can think of each elementary event as a
           possible outcome of an experiment. For the experiment of ﬂipping two distinguish-
           able coins, with each individual ﬂip resulting in a head (H) or a tail (T), we can view
           the sample space as consisting of the set of all possible 2-strings over fH; T g:
           S D fHH; HT ; TH ; TT g :
