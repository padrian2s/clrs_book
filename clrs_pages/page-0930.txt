Because we require that k is not divisible by n, and because !nk D 1 only when k
is divisible by n, we ensure that the denominator is not 0.

The DFT
Recall that we wish to evaluate a polynomial
             X
             n1
A.x/ D              aj x j
             j D0

of degree-bound n at !n0 ; !n1 ; !n2 ; : : : ; !nn1 (that is, at the n complex nth roots of
unity).3 We assume that A is given in coefﬁcient form: a D .a0 ; a1 ; : : : ; an1 /. Let
us deﬁne the results yk , for k D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1, by
yk D A.!nk /
     X
     n1
   D     aj !nkj :                                                                            (30.8)
             j D0

The vector y D .y0 ; y1 ; : : : ; yn1 / is the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the
coefﬁcient vector a D .a0 ; a1 ; : : : ; an1 /. We also write y D DFTn .a/.

The FFT
By using a method known as the fast Fourier transform (FFT), which takes ad-
vantage of the special properties of the complex roots of unity, we can compute
DFTn .a/ in time ‚.n lg n/, as opposed to the ‚.n2 / time of the straightforward
method. We assume throughout that n is an exact power of 2. Although strategies


3 The length n is actually what we referred to as 2n in Section 30.1, since we double the degree-bound

of the given polynomials prior to evaluation. In the context of polynomial multiplication, therefore,
we are actually working with complex .2n/th roots of unity.
