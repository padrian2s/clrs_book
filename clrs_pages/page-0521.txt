      Figure 18.8 Deleting keys from a B-tree. The minimum degree for this B-tree is t D 3, so a node
      (other than the root) cannot have fewer than 2 keys. Nodes that are modiﬁed are lightly shaded.
      (a) The B-tree of Figure 18.7(e). (b) Deletion of F . This is case 1: simple deletion from a leaf.
      (c) Deletion of M . This is case 2a: the predecessor L of M moves up to take M ’s position. (d) Dele-
      tion of G. This is case 2c: we push G down to make node DEGJK and then delete G from this leaf
      (case 1).


         We sketch how deletion works instead of presenting the pseudocode. Figure 18.8
      illustrates the various cases of deleting keys from a B-tree.
      1. If the key k is in node x and x is a leaf, delete the key k from x.
      2. If the key k is in node x and x is an internal node, do the following:
