Figure 31.3 An illustration of the Chinese remainder theorem for n1 D 5 and n2 D 13. For this
example, c1 D 26 and c2 D 40. In row i, column j is shown the value of a, modulo 65, such
that a mod 5 D i and a mod 13 D j . Note that row 0, column 0 contains a 0. Similarly, row 4,
column 12 contains a 64 (equivalent to 1). Since c1 D 26, moving down a row increases a by 26.
Similarly, c2 D 40 means that moving right by a column increases a by 40. Increasing a by 1
corresponds to moving diagonally downward and to the right, wrapping around from the bottom to
the top and from the right to the left.


   As an example of the application of the Chinese remainder theorem, suppose we
are given the two equations
a  2 .mod 5/ ;
a  3 .mod 13/ ;
so that a1 D 2, n1 D m2 D 5, a2 D 3, and n2 D m1 D 13, and we wish
to compute a mod 65, since n D n1 n2 D 65. Because 131  2 .mod 5/ and
51  8 .mod 13/, we have
c1 D 13.2 mod 5/ D 26 ;
c2 D 5.8 mod 13/ D 40 ;
and
a  2  26 C 3  40 .mod 65/
   52 C 120        .mod 65/
   42              .mod 65/ :
See Figure 31.3 for an illustration of the Chinese remainder theorem, modulo 65.
   Thus, we can work modulo n by working modulo n directly or by working in the
transformed representation using separate modulo ni computations, as convenient.
The computations are entirely equivalent.
