650   Chapter 24 Single-Source Shortest Paths


      Triangle inequality (Lemma 24.10)
         For any edge .u; / 2 E, we have ı.s; /  ı.s; u/ C w.u; /.
      Upper-bound property (Lemma 24.11)
        We always have :d  ı.s; / for all vertices  2 V , and once :d achieves the
        value ı.s; /, it never changes.
      No-path property (Corollary 24.12)
        If there is no path from s to , then we always have :d D ı.s; / D 1.
      Convergence property (Lemma 24.14)
        If s ; u !  is a shortest path in G for some u;  2 V , and if u:d D ı.s; u/ at
        any time prior to relaxing edge .u; /, then :d D ı.s; / at all times afterward.
      Path-relaxation property (Lemma 24.15)
         If p D h0 ; 1 ; : : : ; k i is a shortest path from s D 0 to k , and we relax the
         edges of p in the order .0 ; 1 /; .1 ; 2 /; : : : ; .k1 ; k /, then k :d D ı.s; k /.
         This property holds regardless of any other relaxation steps that occur, even if
         they are intermixed with relaxations of the edges of p.
      Predecessor-subgraph property (Lemma 24.17)
         Once :d D ı.s; / for all  2 V , the predecessor subgraph is a shortest-paths
         tree rooted at s.


      Chapter outline
      Section 24.1 presents the Bellman-Ford algorithm, which solves the single-source
      shortest-paths problem in the general case in which edges can have negative weight.
      The Bellman-Ford algorithm is remarkably simple, and it has the further beneﬁt
      of detecting whether a negative-weight cycle is reachable from the source. Sec-
      tion 24.2 gives a linear-time algorithm for computing shortest paths from a single
      source in a directed acyclic graph. Section 24.3 covers Dijkstra’s algorithm, which
      has a lower running time than the Bellman-Ford algorithm but requires the edge
      weights to be nonnegative. Section 24.4 shows how we can use the Bellman-Ford
      algorithm to solve a special case of linear programming. Finally, Section 24.5
      proves the properties of shortest paths and relaxation stated above.
         We require some conventions for doing arithmetic with inﬁnities. We shall as-
      sume that for any real number a ¤ 1, we have a C 1 D 1 C a D 1. Also, to
      make our proofs hold in the presence of negative-weight cycles, we shall assume
      that for any real number a ¤ 1, we have a C .1/ D .1/ C a D 1.
         All algorithms in this chapter assume that the directed graph G is stored in the
      adjacency-list representation. Additionally, stored with each edge is its weight, so
      that as we traverse each adjacency list, we can determine the edge weights in O.1/
      time per edge.
