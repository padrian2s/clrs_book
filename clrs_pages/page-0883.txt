      Figure 29.3 (a) An example of a minimum-cost-ﬂow problem. We denote the capacities by c and
      the costs by a. Vertex s is the source and vertex t is the sink, and we wish to send 4 units of ﬂow
      from s to t. (b) A solution to the minimum-cost ﬂow problem in which 4 units of ﬂow are sent from s
      to t. For each edge, the ﬂow and capacity are written as ﬂow/capacity.

      Multicommodity ﬂow
      As a ﬁnal example, we consider another ﬂow problem. Suppose that the Lucky
      Puck company from Section 26.1 decides to diversify its product line and ship
      not only hockey pucks, but also hockey sticks and hockey helmets. Each piece of
      equipment is manufactured in its own factory, has its own warehouse, and must
      be shipped, each day, from factory to warehouse. The sticks are manufactured in
      Vancouver and must be shipped to Saskatoon, and the helmets are manufactured in
      Edmonton and must be shipped to Regina. The capacity of the shipping network
      does not change, however, and the different items, or commodities, must share the
      same network.
         This example is an instance of a multicommodity-ﬂow problem. In this problem,
      we are again given a directed graph G D .V; E/ in which each edge .u; / 2 E
      has a nonnegative capacity c.u; /  0. As in the maximum-ﬂow problem, we im-
      plicitly assume that c.u; / D 0 for .u; / 62 E, and that the graph has no antipar-
