               Figure 16.2 An example showing that the greedy strategy does not work for the 0-1 knapsack
               problem. (a) The thief must select a subset of the three items shown whose weight must not exceed
               50 pounds. (b) The optimal subset includes items 2 and 3. Any solution with item 1 is suboptimal,
               even though item 1 has the greatest value per pound. (c) For the fractional knapsack problem, taking
               the items in order of greatest value per pound yields an optimal solution.


               choice. The problem formulated in this way gives rise to many overlapping sub-
               problems—a hallmark of dynamic programming, and indeed, as Exercise 16.2-2
               asks you to show, we can use dynamic programming to solve the 0-1 problem.

               Exercises

               16.2-1
               Prove that the fractional knapsack problem has the greedy-choice property.

               16.2-2
               Give a dynamic-programming solution to the 0-1 knapsack problem that runs in
               O.n W / time, where n is the number of items and W is the maximum weight of
               items that the thief can put in his knapsack.

               16.2-3
               Suppose that in a 0-1 knapsack problem, the order of the items when sorted by
               increasing weight is the same as their order when sorted by decreasing value. Give
               an efﬁcient algorithm to ﬁnd an optimal solution to this variant of the knapsack
               problem, and argue that your algorithm is correct.

               16.2-4
               Professor Gekko has always dreamed of inline skating across North Dakota. He
               plans to cross the state on highway U.S. 2, which runs from Grand Forks, on the
               eastern border with Minnesota, to Williston, near the western border with Montana.
