20.2 A recursive structure                                                        543


Finding the successor
The S UCCESSOR operation is even worse. In the worst case, it makes two recursive
calls, along with a call to P ROTO - V EB-M INIMUM. The procedure P ROTO - V EB-
S UCCESSOR.V; x/ returns the smallest element in the proto-vEB structure V that
is greater than x, or NIL if no element in V is greater than x. It does not require x
to be a member of the set, but it does assume that 0  x < V:u.

P ROTO - V EB-S UCCESSOR .V; x/
 1 if V:u == 2
 2        if x == 0 and V:AŒ1 == 1
 3              return 1
 4        else return NIL
 5 else offset D P ROTO - V EB-S UCCESSOR .V:clusterŒhigh.x/; low.x//
 6        if offset ¤ NIL
 7              return index.high.x/; offset/
 8        else succ-cluster D P ROTO - V EB-S UCCESSOR .V:summary; high.x//
 9              if succ-cluster == NIL
10                   return NIL
11              else offset D P ROTO - V EB-M INIMUM .V:clusterŒsucc-cluster/
12                   return index.succ-cluster; offset/

   The P ROTO - V EB-S UCCESSOR procedure works as follows. As usual, line 1
tests for the base case, which lines 2–4 handle by brute force: the only way that x
can have a successor within a proto-EB.2/ structure is when x D 0 and AŒ1
is 1. Lines 5–12 handle the recursive case. Line 5 searches for a successor to x
within x’s cluster, assigning the result to offset. Line 6 determines whether x has
a successor within its cluster; if it does, then line 7 computes and returns the value
of this successor. Otherwise, we have to search in other clusters. Line 8 assigns to
succ-cluster the number of the next nonempty cluster, using the summary informa-
tion to ﬁnd it. Line 9 tests whether succ-cluster is NIL, with line 10 returning NIL
if all succeeding clusters are empty. If succ-cluster is non-NIL, line 11 assigns
the ﬁrst element within that cluster to offset, and line 12 computes and returns the
minimum element in that cluster.
             p case, P ROTO - V EB-S UCCESSOR calls itself recursively twice on
   In the worst
proto-EB. u/  p structures, and it makes one call to P ROTO - V EB-M INIMUM on
a proto-EB. u/ structure. Thus, the recurrence for the worst-case running
time T .u/ of P ROTO - V EB-S UCCESSOR is
                 p             p
T .u/ D 2T . u/ C ‚.lg u/
                 p
        D 2T . u/ C ‚.lg u/ :
