Figure B.8 A complete binary tree of height 3 with 8 leaves and 7 internal nodes.


children of a node are labeled with distinct positive integers. The ith child of a
node is absent if no child is labeled with integer i. A k-ary tree is a positional tree
in which for every node, all children with labels greater than k are missing. Thus,
a binary tree is a k-ary tree with k D 2.
   A complete k-ary tree is a k-ary tree in which all leaves have the same depth
and all internal nodes have degree k. Figure B.8 shows a complete binary tree of
height 3. How many leaves does a complete k-ary tree of height h have? The root
has k children at depth 1, each of which has k children at depth 2, etc. Thus, the
number of leaves at depth h is k h . Consequently, the height of a complete k-ary
tree with n leaves is logk n. The number of internal nodes of a complete k-ary tree
of height h is
