29.3 The simplex algorithm                                                          867


To rewrite the other equations with x6 on the right-hand side, we substitute for x1
using equation (29.62). Doing so for equation (29.59), we obtain
x4 D 30  x1  x2  3x3
                    x2 x3 x6 
    D 30  9                        x2  3x3
                      4    2      4
               3x2 5x3        x6
    D 21                 C      :                                      (29.63)
                 4      2     4
Similarly, we combine equation (29.62) with constraint (29.60) and with objective
function (29.58) to rewrite our linear program in the following form:
                       x2         x3         3x6
 ´ D 27        C            C                                                   (29.64)
                        4          2          4
                       x2         x3          x6
x1 D 9                                                                        (29.65)
                        4          2           4
                      3x2        5x3          x6
x4 D 21                               C                                        (29.66)
                       4          2            4
                      3x2                     x6
x5 D 6                       4x3 C              :                              (29.67)
                       2                       2
We call this operation a pivot. As demonstrated above, a pivot chooses a nonbasic
variable xe , called the entering variable, and a basic variable xl , called the leaving
variable, and exchanges their roles.
   The linear program described in equations (29.64)–(29.67) is equivalent to the
linear program described in equations (29.58)–(29.61). We perform two operations
in the simplex algorithm: rewrite equations so that variables move between the left-
hand side and the right-hand side, and substitute one equation into another. The ﬁrst
operation trivially creates an equivalent problem, and the second, by elementary
linear algebra, also creates an equivalent problem. (See Exercise 29.3-3.)
   To demonstrate this equivalence, observe that our original basic solution .0; 0;
0; 30; 24; 36/ satisﬁes the new equations (29.65)–(29.67) and has objective value
27 C .1=4/  0 C .1=2/  0  .3=4/  36 D 0. The basic solution associated with the
new linear program sets the nonbasic values to 0 and is .9; 0; 0; 21; 6; 0/, with ob-
jective value ´ D 27. Simple arithmetic veriﬁes that this solution also satisﬁes
equations (29.59)–(29.61) and, when plugged into objective function (29.58), has
objective value .3  9/ C .1  0/ C .2  0/ D 27.
   Continuing the example, we wish to ﬁnd a new variable whose value we wish to
increase. We do not want to increase x6 , since as its value increases, the objective
value decreases. We can attempt to increase either x2 or x3 ; let us choose x3 . How
far can we increase x3 without violating any of the constraints? Constraint (29.65)
limits it to 18, constraint (29.66) limits it to 42=5, and constraint (29.67) limits
it to 3=2. The third constraint is again the tightest one, and therefore we rewrite
the third constraint so that x3 is on the left-hand side and x5 is on the right-hand
