the candidates (besides their names), we have made a signiﬁcant change. Instead
of relying on a guess that the candidates come to us in a random order, we have
instead gained control of the process and enforced a random order.
   More generally, we call an algorithm randomized if its behavior is determined
not only by its input but also by values produced by a random-number gener-
ator. We shall assume that we have at our disposal a random-number generator
R ANDOM. A call to R ANDOM.a; b/ returns an integer between a and b, inclu-
sive, with each such integer being equally likely. For example, R ANDOM.0; 1/
produces 0 with probability 1=2, and it produces 1 with probability 1=2. A call to
R ANDOM.3; 7/ returns either 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, each with probability 1=5. Each inte-
ger returned by R ANDOM is independent of the integers returned on previous calls.
You may imagine R ANDOM as rolling a .b  a C 1/-sided die to obtain its out-
put. (In practice, most programming environments offer a pseudorandom-number
generator: a deterministic algorithm returning numbers that “look” statistically
random.)
   When analyzing the running time of a randomized algorithm, we take the expec-
tation of the running time over the distribution of values returned by the random
number generator. We distinguish these algorithms from those in which the input
is random by referring to the running time of a randomized algorithm as an ex-
pected running time. In general, we discuss the average-case running time when
the probability distribution is over the inputs to the algorithm, and we discuss the
expected running time when the algorithm itself makes random choices.

Exercises

5.1-1
Show that the assumption that we are always able to determine which candidate is
best, in line 4 of procedure H IRE -A SSISTANT, implies that we know a total order
on the ranks of the candidates.

5.1-2 ?
Describe an implementation of the procedure R ANDOM.a; b/ that only makes calls
to R ANDOM.0; 1/. What is the expected running time of your procedure, as a
function of a and b?

5.1-3 ?
Suppose that you want to output 0 with probability 1=2 and 1 with probability 1=2.
At your disposal is a procedure B IASED -R ANDOM , that outputs either 0 or 1. It
outputs 1 with some probability p and 0 with probability 1  p, where 0 < p < 1,
but you do not know what p is. Give an algorithm that uses B IASED -R ANDOM
as a subroutine, and returns an unbiased answer, returning 0 with probability 1=2
