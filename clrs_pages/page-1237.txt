Appendix notes

           The ﬁrst general methods for solving probability problems were discussed in a
           famous correspondence between B. Pascal and P. de Fermat, which began in 1654,
           and in a book by C. Huygens in 1657. Rigorous probability theory began with the
           work of J. Bernoulli in 1713 and A. De Moivre in 1730. Further developments of
           the theory were provided by P.-S. Laplace, S.-D. Poisson, and C. F. Gauss.
              Sums of random variables were originally studied by P. L. Chebyshev and A. A.
           Markov. A. N. Kolmogorov axiomatized probability theory in 1933. Chernoff [66]
           and Hoeffding [173] provided bounds on the tails of distributions. Seminal work
           in random combinatorial structures was done by P. Erdös.
              Knuth [209] and Liu [237] are good references for elementary combinatorics
           and counting. Standard textbooks such as Billingsley [46], Chung [67], Drake [95],
           Feller [104], and Rozanov [300] offer comprehensive introductions to probability.
