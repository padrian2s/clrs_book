34.3 NP-completeness and reducibility                                            1077


system.) The circuit C consists of at most t D O.nk / copies of M , and hence it
has size polynomial in n. The reduction algorithm F can construct C from x in
polynomial time, since each step of the construction takes polynomial time.

  The language CIRCUIT-SAT is therefore at least as hard as any language in NP,
and since it belongs to NP, it is NP-complete.

Theorem 34.7
The circuit-satisﬁability problem is NP-complete.

Proof Immediate from Lemmas 34.5 and 34.6 and from the deﬁnition of NP-
completeness.

Exercises

34.3-1
Verify that the circuit in Figure 34.8(b) is unsatisﬁable.

34.3-2
Show that the P relation is a transitive relation on languages. That is, show that if
L1 P L2 and L2 P L3 , then L1 P L3 .

34.3-3
Prove that L P L if and only if L P L.

34.3-4
Show that we could have used a satisfying assignment as a certiﬁcate in an alter-
native proof of Lemma 34.5. Which certiﬁcate makes for an easier proof?

34.3-5
The proof of Lemma 34.6 assumes that the working storage for algorithm A occu-
pies a contiguous region of polynomial size. Where in the proof do we exploit this
assumption? Argue that this assumption does not involve any loss of generality.

34.3-6
A language L is complete for a language class C with respect to polynomial-time
reductions if L 2 C and L0 P L for all L0 2 C . Show that ; and f0; 1g are the
only languages in P that are not complete for P with respect to polynomial-time
reductions.
