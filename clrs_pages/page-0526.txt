19   Fibonacci Heaps




     The Fibonacci heap data structure serves a dual purpose. First, it supports a set of
     operations that constitutes what is known as a “mergeable heap.” Second, several
     Fibonacci-heap operations run in constant amortized time, which makes this data
     structure well suited for applications that invoke these operations frequently.

     Mergeable heaps
     A mergeable heap is any data structure that supports the following ﬁve operations,
     in which each element has a key:
     M AKE -H EAP ./ creates and returns a new heap containing no elements.
     I NSERT .H; x/ inserts element x, whose key has already been ﬁlled in, into heap H .
     M INIMUM .H / returns a pointer to the element in heap H whose key is minimum.
     E XTRACT-M IN .H / deletes the element from heap H whose key is minimum, re-
        turning a pointer to the element.
     U NION .H1 ; H2 / creates and returns a new heap that contains all the elements of
       heaps H1 and H2 . Heaps H1 and H2 are “destroyed” by this operation.
     In addition to the mergeable-heap operations above, Fibonacci heaps also support
     the following two operations:
     D ECREASE -K EY .H; x; k/ assigns to element x within heap H the new key
       value k, which we assume to be no greater than its current key value.1
     D ELETE .H; x/ deletes element x from heap H .


     1 As mentioned in the introduction to Part V, our default mergeable heaps are mergeable min-

     heaps, and so the operations M INIMUM, E XTRACT-M IN, and D ECREASE -K EY apply. Alterna-
     tively, we could deﬁne a mergeable max-heap with the operations M AXIMUM, E XTRACT-M AX,
     and I NCREASE -K EY.
