Index




        This index uses the following conventions. Numbers are alphabetized as if spelled
        out; for example, “2-3-4 tree” is indexed as if it were “two-three-four tree.” When
        an entry refers to a place other than the main text, the page number is followed by
        a tag: ex. for exercise, pr. for problem, ﬁg. for ﬁgure, and n. for footnote. A tagged
        page number often indicates the ﬁrst page of an exercise or problem, which is not
        necessarily the page on which the reference actually appears.
