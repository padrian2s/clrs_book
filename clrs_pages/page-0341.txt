                    Figure 13.5 Case 1 of the procedure RB-I NSERT-F IXUP. Property 4 is violated, since ´ and its
                    parent ´: p are both red. We take the same action whether (a) ´ is a right child or (b) ´ is a left
                    child. Each of the subtrees ˛, ˇ, , ı, and " has a black root, and each has the same black-height.
                    The code for case 1 changes the colors of some nodes, preserving property 5: all downward simple
                    paths from a node to a leaf have the same number of blacks. The while loop continues with node ´’s
                    grandparent ´: p: p as the new ´. Any violation of property 4 can now occur only between the new ´,
                    which is red, and its parent, if it is red as well.


                            If node ´0 is the root at the start of the next iteration, then case 1 corrected
                            the lone violation of property 4 in this iteration. Since ´0 is red and it is the
                            root, property 2 becomes the only one that is violated, and this violation is
                            due to ´0 .
                            If node ´0 is not the root at the start of the next iteration, then case 1 has
                            not created a violation of property 2. Case 1 corrected the lone violation
                            of property 4 that existed at the start of this iteration. It then made ´0 red
                            and left ´0 :p alone. If ´0 :p was black, there is no violation of property 4.
                            If ´0 :p was red, coloring ´0 red created one violation of property 4 between ´0
                            and ´0 :p.


                        Case 2: ´’s uncle y is black and ´ is a right child
                        Case 3: ´’s uncle y is black and ´ is a left child
                        In cases 2 and 3, the color of ´’s uncle y is black. We distinguish the two cases
                        according to whether ´ is a right or left child of ´:p. Lines 10–11 constitute
                        case 2, which is shown in Figure 13.6 together with case 3. In case 2, node ´
                        is a right child of its parent. We immediately use a left rotation to transform
                        the situation into case 3 (lines 12–14), in which node ´ is a left child. Because
