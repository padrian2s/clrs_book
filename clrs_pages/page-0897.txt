876   Chapter 29 Linear Programming


      Lemma 29.3
      Let I be a set of indices. For each j 2 I , let ˛j and ˇj be real numbers, and let xj
      be a real-valued variable. Let be any real number. Suppose that for any settings
      of the xj , we have
      X                 X
          ˛j xj D C         ˇj xj :                                                (29.78)
      j 2I                 j 2I

      Then ˛j D ˇj for each j 2 I , and             D 0.

      Proof Since equation (29.78) holds for any values of the xj , we can use particular
      values to draw conclusions about ˛, ˇ, and . If we let xj D 0 for each j 2 I ,
      we conclude that D 0. Now pick an arbitrary index j 2 I , and set xj D 1 and
      xk D 0 for all k ¤ j . Then we must have ˛j D ˇj . Since we picked j as any
      index in I , we conclude that ˛j D ˇj for each j 2 I .

         A particular linear program has many different slack forms; recall that each slack
      form has the same set of feasible and optimal solutions as the original linear pro-
      gram. We now show that the slack form of a linear program is uniquely determined
      by the set of basic variables. That is, given the set of basic variables, a unique slack
      form (unique set of coefﬁcients and right-hand sides) is associated with those basic
      variables.

      Lemma 29.4
      Let .A; b; c/ be a linear program in standard form. Given a set B of basic variables,
      the associated slack form is uniquely determined.

      Proof Assume for the purpose of contradiction that there are two different slack
      forms with the same set B of basic variables. The slack forms must also have
      identical sets N D f1; 2; : : : ; n C mg  B of nonbasic variables. We write the ﬁrst
      slack form as
                     X
       ´ D C          cj xj                                                       (29.79)
                    j 2N
                       X
      xi     D bi            aij xj for i 2 B ;                                      (29.80)
                       j 2N

      and the second as
                   X
       ´ D 0 C         cj0 xj                                                        (29.81)
                       j 2N
                       X
      xi     D bi0           aij0 xj for i 2 B :                                     (29.82)
                       j 2N
