         A vector is a one-dimensional array of numbers. For example,

       xD      3
               5
       is a vector of size 3. We sometimes call a vector of length n an n-vector. We
       use lowercase letters to denote vectors, and we denote the ith element of a size-n
       vector x by xi , for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n. We take the standard form of a vector to be
       as a column vector equivalent to an n 1 matrix; the corresponding row vector is
       obtained by taking the transpose:
       xT D . 2 3 5 / :
       The unit vector ei is the vector whose ith element is 1 and all of whose other
       elements are 0. Usually, the size of a unit vector is clear from the context.
          A zero matrix is a matrix all of whose entries are 0. Such a matrix is often
       denoted 0, since the ambiguity between the number 0 and a matrix of 0s is usually
       easily resolved from context. If a matrix of 0s is intended, then the size of the
       matrix also needs to be derived from the context.

       Square matrices
       Square n n matrices arise frequently. Several special cases of square matrices
       are of particular interest:
       1. A diagonal matrix has aij D 0 whenever i ¤ j . Because all of the off-diagonal
          elements are zero, we can specify the matrix by listing the elements along the
          diagonal:
                                             ˙a            0 ::: 0
                                                                         
                                                     11
                                                     0    a22 : : : 0
          diag.a11 ; a22 ; : : : ; ann / D           ::    :: ::    ::       :
                                                      :     :     :  :
                                                     0     0 : : : ann
       2. The n     n identity matrix In is a diagonal matrix with 1s along the diagonal:

                     ˙
          In D diag.1; 1; : : : ; 1/
                  1 0 ::: 0
                                             
                  0 1 ::: 0
             D    :: :: : : ::                   :
                   : :        : :
                         0 0 ::: 1
