      L IST-I NSERT .L; x/
      1 x:next D L:head
      2 if L:head ¤ NIL
      3        L:head:pre D x
      4 L:head D x
      5 x:pre D NIL

      (Recall that our attribute notation can cascade, so that L:head:pre denotes the
      pre attribute of the object that L:head points to.) The running time for L IST-
      I NSERT on a list of n elements is O.1/.

      Deleting from a linked list
      The procedure L IST-D ELETE removes an element x from a linked list L. It must
      be given a pointer to x, and it then “splices” x out of the list by updating pointers.
      If we wish to delete an element with a given key, we must ﬁrst call L IST-S EARCH
      to retrieve a pointer to the element.

      L IST-D ELETE .L; x/
      1 if x:pre ¤ NIL
      2       x:pre:next D x:next
      3 else L:head D x:next
      4 if x:next ¤ NIL
      5       x:next:pre D x:pre

      Figure 10.3(c) shows how an element is deleted from a linked list. L IST-D ELETE
      runs in O.1/ time, but if we wish to delete an element with a given key, ‚.n/ time
      is required in the worst case because we must ﬁrst call L IST-S EARCH to ﬁnd the
      element.

      Sentinels
      The code for L IST-D ELETE would be simpler if we could ignore the boundary
      conditions at the head and tail of the list:

      L IST-D ELETE0 .L; x/
      1 x:pre:next D x:next
      2 x:next:pre D x:pre

      A sentinel is a dummy object that allows us to simplify boundary conditions. For
      example, suppose that we provide with list L an object L:nil that represents NIL
