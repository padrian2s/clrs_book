      Exercises

      16.3-1
      Explain why, in the proof of Lemma 16.2, if x:freq D b:freq, then we must have
      a:freq D b:freq D x:freq D y:freq.

      16.3-2
      Prove that a binary tree that is not full cannot correspond to an optimal preﬁx code.

      16.3-3
      What is an optimal Huffman code for the following set of frequencies, based on
      the ﬁrst 8 Fibonacci numbers?
      a:1 b:1 c:2 d:3 e:5 f:8 g:13 h:21
      Can you generalize your answer to ﬁnd the optimal code when the frequencies are
      the ﬁrst n Fibonacci numbers?

      16.3-4
      Prove that we can also express the total cost of a tree for a code as the sum, over
      all internal nodes, of the combined frequencies of the two children of the node.

      16.3-5
      Prove that if we order the characters in an alphabet so that their frequencies
      are monotonically decreasing, then there exists an optimal code whose codeword
      lengths are monotonically increasing.

      16.3-6
      Suppose we have an optimal preﬁx code on a set C D f0; 1; : : : ; n  1g of charac-
      ters and we wish to transmit this code using as few bits as possible. Show how to
      represent any optimal preﬁx code on C using only 2n  1 C n dlg ne bits. (Hint:
      Use 2n  1 bits to specify the structure of the tree, as discovered by a walk of the
      tree.)

      16.3-7
      Generalize Huffman’s algorithm to ternary codewords (i.e., codewords using the
      symbols 0, 1, and 2), and prove that it yields optimal ternary codes.

      16.3-8
      Suppose that a data ﬁle contains a sequence of 8-bit characters such that all 256
      characters are about equally common: the maximum character frequency is less
      than twice the minimum character frequency. Prove that Huffman coding in this
      case is no more efﬁcient than using an ordinary 8-bit ﬁxed-length code.
