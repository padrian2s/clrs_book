1144   Part VIII Appendix: Mathematical Background


          Appendix D deﬁnes matrices, their operations, and some of their basic prop-
       erties. You have probably seen most of this material already if you have taken a
       course in linear algebra, but you might ﬁnd it helpful to have one place to look for
       our notation and deﬁnitions.
