       follows from equation (B.3). For example, each position on a car’s license plate
       is a letter or a digit. The number of possibilities for each position is therefore
       26 C 10 D 36, since there are 26 choices if it is a letter and 10 choices if it is a
       digit.
          The rule of product says that the number of ways to choose an ordered pair is the
       number of ways to choose the ﬁrst element times the number of ways to choose the
       second element. That is, if A and B are two ﬁnite sets, then jA Bj D jAj  jBj,
       which is simply equation (B.4). For example, if an ice-cream parlor offers 28
       ﬂavors of ice cream and 4 toppings, the number of possible sundaes with one scoop
       of ice cream and one topping is 28  4 D 112.

       Strings
       A string over a ﬁnite set S is a sequence of elements of S. For example, there are 8
       binary strings of length 3:
       000; 001; 010; 011; 100; 101; 110; 111 :
       We sometimes call a string of length k a k-string. A substring s 0 of a string s
       is an ordered sequence of consecutive elements of s. A k-substring of a string
       is a substring of length k. For example, 010 is a 3-substring of 01101001 (the
       3-substring that begins in position 4), but 111 is not a substring of 01101001.
          We can view a k-string over a set S as an element of the Cartesian product S k
       of k-tuples; thus, there are jSjk strings of length k. For example, the number of
       binary k-strings is 2k . Intuitively, to construct a k-string over an n-set, we have n
       ways to pick the ﬁrst element; for each of these choices, we have n ways to pick the
       second element; and so forth k times. This construction leads to the k-fold product
       n  n    n D nk as the number of k-strings.

       Permutations
       A permutation of a ﬁnite set S is an ordered sequence of all the elements of S,
       with each element appearing exactly once. For example, if S D fa; b; cg, then S
       has 6 permutations:
       abc; acb; bac; bca; cab; cba :
       There are nŠ permutations of a set of n elements, since we can choose the ﬁrst
       element of the sequence in n ways, the second in n  1 ways, the third in n  2
       ways, and so on.
          A k-permutation of S is an ordered sequence of k elements of S, with no ele-
       ment appearing more than once in the sequence. (Thus, an ordinary permutation is
       an n-permutation of an n-set.) The twelve 2-permutations of the set fa; b; c; d g are
