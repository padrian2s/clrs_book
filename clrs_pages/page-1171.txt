          You don’t always need to guess the exact value of a summation in order to use
       mathematical induction. Instead, you can use induction to proveP   a bound on a sum-
       mation. As an example, let us provePthat the geometric series nkD0 3k is O.3n /.
                                               n
       More speciﬁcally, let us prove that kD0 3k  c3n for some constant c. For the
                                         P0
       initial condition n D 0, we have kD0 3k D 1  c  1 as long as c  1. Assuming
       that the bound holds for n, let us prove that it holds for n C 1. We have
       X
       nC1            X

                        n
                                   (by the inductive hypothesis)
                          

                 D     C     c3nC1
                     3   c
                  c3nC1
                                                                   Pn
       as long as .1=3 C 1=c/  1 or, equivalently, c  3=2. Thus, kD0 3k D O.3n /,
       as we wished to show.
          We have to be careful when we use asymptotic notation
                                                            Pn to prove bounds by in-
       duction. Consider the following fallacious proof that kD1 k D O.n/. Certainly,
       P1
          kD1 k D O.1/. Assuming that the bound holds for n, we now prove it for n C 1:

       X
       nC1           X
                     n
             k D           k C .n C 1/
       kD1           kD1
                 D O.n/ C .n C 1/                wrong!!
                 D O.n C 1/ :
       The bug in the argument is that the “constant” hidden by the “big-oh” grows with n
       and thus is not constant. We have not shown that the same constant works for all n.

       Bounding the terms
       We can sometimes obtain a good upper bound on a series by bounding each term
       of the series, and it often sufﬁces to use the largest term to bound the others. For
