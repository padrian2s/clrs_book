Suppose we shufﬂe a deck of 10 cards, each bearing a distinct number from 1 to 10,
to mix the cards thoroughly. We then remove three cards, one at a time, from the
deck. What is the probability that we select the three cards in sorted (increasing)
order?

Describe a procedure that takes as input two integers a and b such that 0 < a < b
and, using fair coin ﬂips, produces as output heads with probability a=b and tails
with probability .b  a/=b. Give a bound on the expected number of coin ﬂips,
which should be O.1/. (Hint: Represent a=b in binary.)

C.2-7 ?
Show how to construct a set of n events that are pairwise independent but such that
no subset of k > 2 of them is mutually independent.

C.2-8 ?
Two events A and B are conditionally independent, given C , if
Pr fA \ B j C g D Pr fA j C g  Pr fB j C g :
Give a simple but nontrivial example of two events that are not independent but are
conditionally independent given a third event.

You are a contestant in a game show in which a prize is hidden behind one of
three curtains. You will win the prize if you select the correct curtain. After you
