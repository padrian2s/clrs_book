           c. Show that by removing at most O.lg n/ edges, we can partition the vertices
              of any n-vertex binary tree into two sets A and B such that jAj D bn=2c
              and jBj D dn=2e.


Appendix notes

           G. Boole pioneered the development of symbolic logic, and he introduced many of
           the basic set notations in a book published in 1854. Modern set theory was created
           by G. Cantor during the period 1874–1895. Cantor focused primarily on sets of
           inﬁnite cardinality. The term “function” is attributed to G. W. Leibniz, who used it
           to refer to several kinds of mathematical formulas. His limited deﬁnition has been
           generalized many times. Graph theory originated in 1736, when L. Euler proved
           that it was impossible to cross each of the seven bridges in the city of Königsberg
           exactly once and return to the starting point.
              The book by Harary [160] provides a useful compendium of many deﬁnitions
           and results from graph theory.
