Relatively prime integers
Two integers a and b are relatively prime if their only common divisor is 1, that
is, if gcd.a; b/ D 1. For example, 8 and 15 are relatively prime, since the divisors
of 8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8, and the divisors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15. The following
theorem states that if two integers are each relatively prime to an integer p, then
their product is relatively prime to p.

Theorem 31.6
For any integers a, b, and p, if both gcd.a; p/ D 1 and gcd.b; p/ D 1, then
gcd.ab; p/ D 1.

Proof    It follows from Theorem 31.2 that there exist integers x, y, x 0 , and y 0 such
that
ax C py D 1 ;
bx 0 C py 0 D 1 :
Multiplying these equations and rearranging, we have
ab.xx 0/ C p.ybx 0 C y 0 ax C pyy 0 / D 1 :
Since 1 is thus a positive linear combination of ab and p, an appeal to Theo-
rem 31.2 completes the proof.

  Integers n1 , n2 , . . . , nk are pairwise relatively prime if, whenever i ¤ j , we
have gcd.ni ; nj / D 1.

Unique factorization
An elementary but important fact about divisibility by primes is the following.

Theorem 31.7
For all primes p and all integers a and b, if p j ab, then p j a or p j b (or both).

Proof Assume for the purpose of contradiction that p j ab, but that p − a and
p − b. Thus, gcd.a; p/ D 1 and gcd.b; p/ D 1, since the only divisors of p are 1
and p, and we assume that p divides neither a nor b. Theorem 31.6 then implies
that gcd.ab; p/ D 1, contradicting our assumption that p j ab, since p j ab
implies gcd.ab; p/ D p. This contradiction completes the proof.

   A consequence of Theorem 31.7 is that we can uniquely factor any composite
integer into a product of primes.
