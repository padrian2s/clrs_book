C.4 The geometric and binomial distributions                                      1203


   Assuming that q < 1, we can calculate the expectation of a geometric distribu-
tion using identity (A.8):
             X
             1
E ŒX  D         kq k1 p
             kD1

             pX k
                   1
        D          kq
             q
               kD0
             p      q
        D      
             q .1  q/2
             p q
        D      
             q p2
        D    1=p :                                                              (C.32)
Thus, on average, it takes 1=p trials before we obtain a success, an intuitive result.
The variance, which can be calculated similarly, but using Exercise A.1-3, is
Var ŒX  D q=p 2 :                                                              (C.33)
   As an example, suppose we repeatedly roll two dice until we obtain either a
seven or an eleven. Of the 36 possible outcomes, 6 yield a seven and 2 yield an
eleven. Thus, the probability of success is p D 8=36 D 2=9, and we must roll
1=p D 9=2 D 4:5 times on average to obtain a seven or eleven.

The binomial distribution
How many successes occur during n Bernoulli trials, where a success occurs with
probability p and a failure with probability q D 1  p? Deﬁne the random vari-
able X to be the number of successes in n trials. Then X has values in the range
f0; 1; : : : ; ng, and for k D 0; 1; : : : ; n,
                        !
                      n k nk
Pr fX D kg D              p q    ;                                        (C.34)
                      k
since there are kn ways to pick which k of the n trials are successes, and the
probability that each occurs is p k q nk . A probability distribution satisfying equa-
tion (C.34) is said to be a binomial distribution. For convenience, we deﬁne the
family of binomial distributions using the notation
                  !
                n k
b.kI n; p/ D        p .1  p/nk :                                               (C.35)
                k
Figure C.2 illustrates a binomial distribution. The name “binomial” comes from the
right-hand side of equation (C.34) being the kth term of the expansion of .p C q/n .
Consequently, since p C q D 1,
