           32.4-4
           Use an aggregate analysis to show that the running time of KMP-M ATCHER
           is ‚.n/.

           32.4-5
           Use a potential function to show that the running time of KMP-M ATCHER is ‚.n/.

           32.4-6
           Show how to improve KMP-M ATCHER by replacing the occurrence of  in line 7
           (but not line 12) by  0 , where  0 is deﬁned recursively for q D 1; 2; : : : ; m  1 by

                     0
           the equation

                      Œq     if Œq ¤ 0 and P ŒŒq C 1 ¤ P Œq C 1 :
           Explain why the modiﬁed algorithm is correct, and explain in what sense this
           change constitutes an improvement.

           32.4-7
           Give a linear-time algorithm to determine whether a text T is a cyclic rotation of
           another string T 0 . For example, arc and car are cyclic rotations of each other.

           32.4-8 ?
           Give an O.m j†j/-time algorithm for computing the transition function ı for the
           string-matching automaton corresponding to a given pattern P . (Hint: Prove that
           ı.q; a/ D ı.Œq; a/ if q D m or P Œq C 1 ¤ a.)



Problems

           32-1 String matching based on repetition factors
           Let y i denote the concatenation of string y with itself i times. For example,
           .ab/3 D ababab. We say that a string x 2 † has repetition factor r if x D y r
           for some string y 2 † and some r > 0. Let .x/ denote the largest r such that x
           has repetition factor r.

           a. Give an efﬁcient algorithm that takes as input a pattern P Œ1 : : m and computes
              the value .Pi / for i D 1; 2; : : : ; m. What is the running time of your algo-
              rithm?
