      Figure 6.1 A max-heap viewed as (a) a binary tree and (b) an array. The number within the circle
      at each node in the tree is the value stored at that node. The number above a node is the corresponding
      index in the array. Above and below the array are lines showing parent-child relationships; parents
      are always to the left of their children. The tree has height three; the node at index 4 (with value 8)
      has height one.


      PARENT .i/
      1 return bi=2c

      L EFT .i/
      1 return 2i

      R IGHT .i/
      1 return 2i C 1

      On most computers, the L EFT procedure can compute 2i in one instruction by
      simply shifting the binary representation of i left by one bit position. Similarly, the
      R IGHT procedure can quickly compute 2i C 1 by shifting the binary representation
      of i left by one bit position and then adding in a 1 as the low-order bit. The
      PARENT procedure can compute bi=2c by shifting i right one bit position. Good
      implementations of heapsort often implement these procedures as “macros” or “in-
      line” procedures.
         There are two kinds of binary heaps: max-heaps and min-heaps. In both kinds,
      the values in the nodes satisfy a heap property, the speciﬁcs of which depend on
      the kind of heap. In a max-heap, the max-heap property is that for every node i
      other than the root,

      that is, the value of a node is at most the value of its parent. Thus, the largest
      element in a max-heap is stored at the root, and the subtree rooted at a node contains
