      assigned implicitly to each edge. This new algorithm takes a different approach and
      assigns a length of 0 to high-capacity edges and a length of 1 to low-capacity edges.
      Informally, with respect to these lengths, shortest paths from the source to the sink
      tend have high capacity, which means that fewer iterations need be performed.
         In practice, push-relabel algorithms currently dominate augmenting-path or
      linear-programming based algorithms for the maximum-ﬂow problem. A study
      by Cherkassky and Goldberg [63] underscores the importance of using two heuris-
      tics when implementing a push-relabel algorithm. The ﬁrst heuristic is to peri-
      odically perform a breadth-ﬁrst search of the residual network in order to obtain
      more accurate height values. The second heuristic is the gap heuristic, described in
      Exercise 26.5-5. Cherkassky and Goldberg conclude that the best choice of push-
      relabel variants is the one that chooses to discharge the overﬂowing vertex with the
      maximum height.
         The best algorithm to date for maximum
                                            p           bipartite matching, discovered by
      Hopcroft and Karp [176], runs in O. V E/ time and is described in Problem 26-6.
      The book by Lovász and Plummer [239] is an excellent reference on matching
      problems.
