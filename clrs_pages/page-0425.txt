                k2 is the root
                k1 is the left child of k2
                d0 is the left child of k1
                d1 is the right child of k1
                k5 is the right child of k2
                k4 is the left child of k5
                k3 is the left child of k4
                d2 is the left child of k3
                d3 is the right child of k3
                d4 is the right child of k4
                d5 is the right child of k5
           corresponding to the optimal binary search tree shown in Figure 15.9(b).

           15.5-2
           Determine the cost and structure of an optimal binary search tree for a set of n D 7
           keys with the following probabilities:
            i     0      1       2      3      4       5      6      7
           pi           0.04   0.06   0.08    0.02   0.10   0.12   0.14
           qi    0.06   0.06   0.06   0.06    0.05   0.05   0.05   0.05


           15.5-3
           Suppose that instead of maintaining the table wŒi; j , we computed the value
           of w.i; j / directly from equation (15.12) in line 9 of O PTIMAL -BST and used this
           computed value in line 11. How would this change affect the asymptotic running
           time of O PTIMAL -BST?

           15.5-4 ?
           Knuth [212] has shown that there are always roots of optimal subtrees such that
           rootŒi; j  1  rootŒi; j   rootŒi C 1; j  for all 1  i < j  n. Use this fact to
           modify the O PTIMAL -BST procedure to run in ‚.n2 / time.



Problems

           15-1 Longest simple path in a directed acyclic graph
           Suppose that we are given a directed acyclic graph G D .V; E/ with real-
           valued edge weights and two distinguished vertices s and t. Describe a dynamic-
           programming approach for ﬁnding a longest weighted simple path from s to t.
           What does the subproblem graph look like? What is the efﬁciency of your algo-
           rithm?
