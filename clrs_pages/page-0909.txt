888   Chapter 29 Linear Programming


         I NITIALIZE -S IMPLEX works as follows. In lines 1–3, we implicitly test the
      basic solution to the initial slack form for L given by N D f1; 2; : : : ; ng, B D
      fn C 1; n C 2; : : : ; n C mg, xN i D bi for all i 2 B, and xNj D 0 for all j 2 N .
      (Creating the slack form requires no explicit effort, as the values of A, b, and c are
      the same in both slack and standard forms.) If line 2 ﬁnds this basic solution to be
      feasible—that is, xN i  0 for all i 2 N [ B—then line 3 returns the slack form.
      Otherwise, in line 4, we form the auxiliary linear program Laux as in Lemma 29.11.
      Since the initial basic solution to L is not feasible, the initial basic solution to the
      slack form for Laux cannot be feasible either. To ﬁnd a basic feasible solution, we
      perform a single pivot operation. Line 6 selects l D n C k as the index of the
      basic variable that will be the leaving variable in the upcoming pivot operation.
      Since the basic variables are xnC1 ; xnC2 ; : : : ; xnCm , the leaving variable xl will be
      the one with the most negative value. Line 8 performs that call of P IVOT, with
      x0 entering and xl leaving. We shall see shortly that the basic solution resulting
      from this call of P IVOT will be feasible. Now that we have a slack form for which
      the basic solution is feasible, we can, in line 10, repeatedly call P IVOT to fully
      solve the auxiliary linear program. As the test in line 11 demonstrates, if we ﬁnd
      an optimal solution to Laux with objective value 0, then in lines 12–14, we create
      a slack form for L for which the basic solution is feasible. To do so, we ﬁrst,
      in lines 12–13, handle the degenerate case in which x0 may still be basic with
      value xN 0 D 0. In this case, we perform a pivot step to remove x0 from the basis,
      using any e 2 N such that a0e ¤ 0 as the entering variable. The new basic
      solution remains feasible; the degenerate pivot does not change the value of any
      variable. Next we delete all x0 terms from the constraints and restore the original
      objective function for L. The original objective function may contain both basic
      and nonbasic variables. Therefore, in the objective function we replace each basic
      variable by the right-hand side of its associated constraint. Line 15 then returns
      this modiﬁed slack form. If, on the other hand, line 11 discovers that the original
      linear program L is infeasible, then line 16 returns this information.
         We now demonstrate the operation of I NITIALIZE -S IMPLEX on the linear pro-
      gram (29.102)–(29.105). This linear program is feasible if we can ﬁnd nonneg-
      ative values for x1 and x2 that satisfy inequalities (29.103) and (29.104). Using
      Lemma 29.11, we formulate the auxiliary linear program
      maximize                            x0                                         (29.109)

      By Lemma 29.11, if the optimal objective value of this auxiliary linear program
      is 0, then the original linear program has a feasible solution. If the optimal objective
