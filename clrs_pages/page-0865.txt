      Figure 29.1 The effects of policies on voters. Each entry describes the number of thousands of
      urban, suburban, or rural voters who could be won over by spending $1,000 on advertising support
      of a policy on a particular issue. Negative entries denote votes that would be lost.


      would win 20.2/C0.8/C4.0/C9.10/ D 50 thousand urban votes, 20.5/C0.2/C
      4.0/C9.0/ D 100 thousand suburban votes, and 20.3/C0.5/C4.10/C9.2/ D
      82 thousand rural votes. You would win the exact number of votes desired in the
      urban and suburban areas and more than enough votes in the rural area. (In fact,
      in the rural area, you would receive more votes than there are voters.) In order to
      garner these votes, you would have paid for 20 C 0 C 4 C 9 D 33 thousand dollars
      of advertising.
         Naturally, you may wonder whether this strategy is the best possible. That is,
      could you achieve your goals while spending less on advertising? Additional trial
      and error might help you to answer this question, but wouldn’t you rather have a
      systematic method for answering such questions? In order to develop one, we shall
      formulate this question mathematically. We introduce 4 variables:
         x1 is the number of thousands of dollars spent on advertising on building roads,
         x2 is the number of thousands of dollars spent on advertising on gun control,
         x3 is the number of thousands of dollars spent on advertising on farm subsidies,
          and
         x4 is the number of thousands of dollars spent on advertising on a gasoline tax.
      We can write the requirement that we win at least 50,000 urban votes as
      2x1 C 8x2 C 0x3 C 10x4  50 :                                                          (29.1)
      Similarly, we can write the requirements that we win at least 100,000 suburban
      votes and 25,000 rural votes as
      5x1 C 2x2 C 0x3 C 0x4  100                                                             (29.2)
      and
      3x1  5x2 C 10x3  2x4  25 :                                                           (29.3)
      Any setting of the variables x1 ; x2 ; x3 ; x4 that satisﬁes inequalities (29.1)–(29.3)
      yields a strategy that wins a sufﬁcient number of each type of vote. In order to
