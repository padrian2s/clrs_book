      X
      n
             aij xj  bi
      j D1

      is equivalent to
      X
      n
             aij xj  bi :
      j D1

      Thus, by replacing each coefﬁcient aij by aij and each value bi by bi , we obtain
      an equivalent less-than-or-equal-to constraint.
        Finishing our example, we replace the equality in constraint (29.22) by two in-
      equalities, obtaining
      maximize        2x1     3x20        C 3x200
      subject to
                       x1 C x20             x200       7
                       x1 C x20             x200       7                         (29.23)
                       x1  2x20           C 2x200      4
                         x1 ; x20 ; x200                0 :
      Finally, we negate constraint (29.23). For consistency in variable names, we re-
      name x20 to x2 and x200 to x3 , obtaining the standard form
      maximize        2x1      3x2        C 3x3                                   (29.24)
      subject to
                       x1 C x2              x3        7                          (29.25)
                      x1  x2             C x3       7                          (29.26)
                       x1  2x2            C 2x3       4                          (29.27)
                         x1 ; x2 ; x3                  0 :                        (29.28)

      Converting linear programs into slack form
      To efﬁciently solve a linear program with the simplex algorithm, we prefer to ex-
      press it in a form in which some of the constraints are equality constraints. More
      precisely, we shall convert it into a form in which the nonnegativity constraints are
      the only inequality constraints, and the remaining constraints are equalities. Let
      X
      n
             aij xj  bi                                                           (29.29)
