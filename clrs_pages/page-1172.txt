A.2 Bounding summations                                                          1151


example, a quick upper bound on the arithmetic series (A.1) is
X
n               X
                n
      k              n
kD1             kD1

           D n2 :
                                 Pn
In general, for a series          kD1 ak , if we let amax D max1kn ak , then

X
n
      ak  n  amax :
kD1

   The technique of bounding each term in a series by the largest term is a weak
methodPwhen the series can in fact be bounded by a geometric series. Given the
         n
series kD0 ak , suppose that akC1 =ak  r for all k  0, where 0 < r < 1 is a
constant. We can bound the sum by an inﬁnite decreasing geometric series, since
ak  a0 r k , and thus
X
n               X
                1
      ak             a0 r k
kD0             kD0
                      X
                      1
           D a0             rk
                      kD0
                       1
           D a0           :
                      1r
                                                           P1        k
   We can apply this method to bound the summation   P1      kD1 .k=3 /. In order to
                                                                     kC1
start the summation at k D 0, we rewrite it as kD0 ..k C 1/=3 /. The ﬁrst
term (a0 ) is 1=3, and the ratio (r) of consecutive terms is
.k C 2/=3kC2                 1 kC2
                      D        
.k C 1/=3kC1                 3 kC1
                             2

                             3
for all k  0. Thus, we have
