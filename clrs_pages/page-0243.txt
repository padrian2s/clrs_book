      We show that the running time is linear by substitution. More speciﬁcally, we will
      show that T .n/  cn for some suitably large constant c and all n > 0. We begin by
      assuming that T .n/  cn for some suitably large constant c and all n < 140; this
      assumption holds if c is large enough. We also pick a constant a such that the func-
      tion described by the O.n/ term above (which describes the non-recursive compo-
      nent of the running time of the algorithm) is bounded above by an for all n > 0.
      Substituting this inductive hypothesis into the right-hand side of the recurrence
      yields
      T .n/         c dn=5e C c.7n=10 C 6/ C an

      which is at most cn if
      cn=10 C 7c C an  0 :                                                          (9.2)
      Inequality (9.2) is equivalent to the inequality c  10a.n=.n  70// when n > 70.
      Because we assume that n  140, we have n=.n  70/  2, and so choos-
      ing c  20a will satisfy inequality (9.2). (Note that there is nothing special about
      the constant 140; we could replace it by any integer strictly greater than 70 and
      then choose c accordingly.) The worst-case running time of S ELECT is therefore
      linear.
         As in a comparison sort (see Section 8.1), S ELECT and R ANDOMIZED -S ELECT
      determine information about the relative order of elements only by comparing ele-
      ments. Recall from Chapter 8 that sorting requires .n lg n/ time in the compari-
      son model, even on average (see Problem 8-1). The linear-time sorting algorithms
      in Chapter 8 make assumptions about the input. In contrast, the linear-time se-
      lection algorithms in this chapter do not require any assumptions about the input.
      They are not subject to the .n lg n/ lower bound because they manage to solve
      the selection problem without sorting. Thus, solving the selection problem by sort-
      ing and indexing, as presented in the introduction to this chapter, is asymptotically
      inefﬁcient.
