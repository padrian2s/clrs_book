       Figure C.2 The binomial distribution b.kI 15; 1=3/ resulting from n D 15 Bernoulli trials, each
       with probability p D 1=3 of success. The expectation of the distribution is np D 5.

       as axiom 2 of the probability axioms requires.
          We can compute the expectation of a random variable having a binomial distri-
       bution from equations (C.8) and (C.36). Let X be a random variable that follows
       the binomial distribution b.kI n; p/, and let q D 1  p. By the deﬁnition of expec-
       tation, we have
