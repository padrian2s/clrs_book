  Figure 23.2 Two ways of viewing a cut .S; V  S/ of the graph from Figure 23.1. (a) Black
  vertices are in the set S, and white vertices are in V  S. The edges crossing the cut are those
  connecting white vertices with black vertices. The edge .d; c/ is the unique light edge crossing the
  cut. A subset A of the edges is shaded; note that the cut .S; V  S/ respects A, since no edge of A
  crosses the cut. (b) The same graph with the vertices in the set S on the left and the vertices in the
  set V  S on the right. An edge crosses the cut if it connects a vertex on the left with a vertex on the
  right.


  Proof Let T be a minimum spanning tree that includes A, and assume that T
  does not contain the light edge .u; /, since if it does, we are done. We shall
  construct another minimum spanning tree T 0 that includes A [ f.u; /g by using a
  cut-and-paste technique, thereby showing that .u; / is a safe edge for A.
     The edge .u; / forms a cycle with the edges on the simple path p from u
  to  in T , as Figure 23.3 illustrates. Since u and  are on opposite sides of the
  cut .S; V  S/, at least one edge in T lies on the simple path p and also crosses
  the cut. Let .x; y/ be any such edge. The edge .x; y/ is not in A, because the cut
  respects A. Since .x; y/ is on the unique simple path from u to  in T , remov-
  ing .x; y/ breaks T into two components. Adding .u; / reconnects them to form
  a new spanning tree T 0 D T  f.x; y/g [ f.u; /g.
     We next show that T 0 is a minimum spanning tree. Since .u; / is a light edge
  crossing .S; V S/ and .x; y/ also crosses this cut, w.u; /  w.x; y/. Therefore,
  w.T 0 / D w.T /  w.x; y/ C w.u; /
