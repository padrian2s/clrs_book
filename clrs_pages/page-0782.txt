Figure 26.11 Grids for the escape problem. Starting points are black, and other grid vertices are
white. (a) A grid with an escape, shown by shaded paths. (b) A grid with no escape.


b. Describe an efﬁcient algorithm to solve the escape problem, and analyze its
   running time.

26-2 Minimum path cover
A path cover of a directed graph G D .V; E/ is a set P of vertex-disjoint paths
such that every vertex in V is included in exactly one path in P . Paths may start
and end anywhere, and they may be of any length, including 0. A minimum path
cover of G is a path cover containing the fewest possible paths.
a. Give an efﬁcient algorithm to ﬁnd a minimum path cover of a directed acyclic
   graph G D .V; E/. (Hint: Assuming that V D f1; 2; : : : ; ng, construct the
   graph G 0 D .V 0 ; E 0 /, where
    V 0 D fx0 ; x1 ; : : : ; xn g [ fy0 ; y1 ; : : : ; yn g ;
    E 0 D f.x0 ; xi / W i 2 V g [ f.yi ; y0 / W i 2 V g [ f.xi ; yj / W .i; j / 2 Eg ;
    and run a maximum-ﬂow algorithm.)

b. Does your algorithm work for directed graphs that contain cycles? Explain.

26-3 Algorithmic consulting
Professor Gore wants to open up an algorithmic consulting company. He has iden-
tiﬁed n important subareas of algorithms (roughly corresponding to different por-
tions of this textbook), which he represents by the set A D fA1 ; A2 ; : : : ; An g. In
each subarea Ak , he can hire an expert in that area for ck dollars. The consulting
company has lined up a set J D fJ1 ; J2 ; : : : ; Jm g of potential jobs. In order to
perform job Ji , the company needs to have hired experts in a subset Ri  A of
