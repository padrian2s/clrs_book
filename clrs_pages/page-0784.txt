Problems for Chapter 26                                                       763


We can use the following modiﬁcation of F ORD -F ULKERSON -M ETHOD to com-
pute a maximum ﬂow in G:

M AX -F LOW-B Y-S CALING .G; s; t/
1 C D max.u;/2E c.u; /
2 initialize ﬂow f to 0
3 K D 2blg C c
4 while K  1
5       while there exists an augmenting path p of capacity at least K
6           augment ﬂow f along p
7       K D K=2
8 return f

c. Argue that M AX -F LOW-B Y-S CALING returns a maximum ﬂow.

d. Show that the capacity of a minimum cut of the residual network Gf is at most
   2K jEj each time line 4 is executed.

e. Argue that the inner while loop of lines 5–6 executes O.E/ times for each value
   of K.

f. Conclude that M AX -F LOW-B Y-S CALING can be implemented so that it runs
   in O.E 2 lg C / time.

26-6 The Hopcroft-Karp bipartite matching algorithm
In this problem, we describe a faster algorithm, due to Hopcroft and Karp,p for
ﬁnding a maximum matching in a bipartite graph. The algorithm runs in O. V E/
time. Given an undirected, bipartite graph G D .V; E/, where V D L [ R and
all edges have exactly one endpoint in L, let M be a matching in G. We say that
a simple path P in G is an augmenting path with respect to M if it starts at an
unmatched vertex in L, ends at an unmatched vertex in R, and its edges belong
alternately to M and E  M . (This deﬁnition of an augmenting path is related
to, but different from, an augmenting path in a ﬂow network.) In this problem,
we treat a path as a sequence of edges, rather than as a sequence of vertices. A
shortest augmenting path with respect to a matching M is an augmenting path
with a minimum number of edges.
   Given two sets A and B, the symmetric difference A˚B is deﬁned as .AB/[
.B  A/, that is, the elements that are in exactly one of the two sets.
