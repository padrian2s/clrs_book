      3. Strassen’s algorithm is not quite as numerically stable as S QUARE -M ATRIX -
         M ULTIPLY. In other words, because of the limited precision of computer arith-
         metic on noninteger values, larger errors accumulate in Strassen’s algorithm
         than in S QUARE -M ATRIX -M ULTIPLY.
      4. The submatrices formed at the levels of recursion consume space.
      The latter two reasons were mitigated around 1990. Higham [167] demonstrated
      that the difference in numerical stability had been overemphasized; although
      Strassen’s algorithm is too numerically unstable for some applications, it is within
      acceptable limits for others. Bailey, Lee, and Simon [32] discuss techniques for
      reducing the memory requirements for Strassen’s algorithm.
         In practice, fast matrix-multiplication implementations for dense matrices use
      Strassen’s algorithm for matrix sizes above a “crossover point,” and they switch
      to a simpler method once the subproblem size reduces to below the crossover
      point. The exact value of the crossover point is highly system dependent. Analyses
      that count operations but ignore effects from caches and pipelining have produced
      crossover points as low as n D 8 (by Higham [167]) or n D 12 (by Huss-Lederman
      et al. [186]). D’Alberto and Nicolau [81] developed an adaptive scheme, which
      determines the crossover point by benchmarking when their software package is
      installed. They found crossover points on various systems ranging from n D 400
      to n D 2150, and they could not ﬁnd a crossover point on a couple of systems.
         Recurrences were studied as early as 1202 by L. Fibonacci, for whom the Fi-
      bonacci numbers are named. A. De Moivre introduced the method of generating
      functions (see Problem 4-4) for solving recurrences. The master method is adapted
      from Bentley, Haken, and Saxe [44], which provides the extended method justiﬁed
      by Exercise 4.6-2. Knuth [209] and Liu [237] show how to solve linear recurrences
      using the method of generating functions. Purdom and Brown [287] and Graham,
      Knuth, and Patashnik [152] contain extended discussions of recurrence solving.
         Several researchers, including Akra and Bazzi [13], Roura [299], Verma [346],
      and Yap [360], have given methods for solving more general divide-and-conquer
      recurrences than are solved by the master method. We describe the result of Akra
      and Bazzi here, as modiﬁed by Leighton [228]. The Akra-Bazzi method works for
      recurrences of the form
                (
