A          Summations




           When an algorithm contains an iterative control construct such as a while or for
           loop, we can express its running time as the sum of the times spent on each exe-
           cution of the body of the loop. For example, we found in Section 2.2 that the j th
           iteration of insertion sort took time proportional to j in the worst case. By adding
           up the time spent on each iteration, we obtained the summation (or series)
           X n
                j :
           j D2

           When we evaluated this summation, we attained a bound of ‚.n2 / on the worst-
           case running time of the algorithm. This example illustrates why you should know
           how to manipulate and bound summations.
              Section A.1 lists several basic formulas involving summations. Section A.2 of-
           fers useful techniques for bounding summations. We present the formulas in Sec-
           tion A.1 without proof, though proofs for some of them appear in Section A.2 to
           illustrate the methods of that section. You can ﬁnd most of the other proofs in any
           calculus text.


A.1 Summation formulas and properties

           Given a sequence a1 ; a2 ; : : : ; an of numbers, where n is a nonnegative integer, we
           can write the ﬁnite sum a1 C a2 C    C an as
           Xn
               ak :
           kD1

           If n D 0, the value of the summation is deﬁned to be 0. The value of a ﬁnite series
           is always well deﬁned, and we can add its terms in any order.
              Given an inﬁnite sequence a1 ; a2 ; : : : of numbers, we can write the inﬁnite sum
           a1 C a2 C    as
