the worst case, the running time of I NSERTION -S ORT is

We can express this worst-case running time as an2 C bn C c for constants a, b,
and c that again depend on the statement costs ci ; it is thus a quadratic function
of n.
   Typically, as in insertion sort, the running time of an algorithm is ﬁxed for a
given input, although in later chapters we shall see some interesting “randomized”
algorithms whose behavior can vary even for a ﬁxed input.

Worst-case and average-case analysis
In our analysis of insertion sort, we looked at both the best case, in which the input
array was already sorted, and the worst case, in which the input array was reverse
sorted. For the remainder of this book, though, we shall usually concentrate on
ﬁnding only the worst-case running time, that is, the longest running time for any
input of size n. We give three reasons for this orientation.
      The worst-case running time of an algorithm gives us an upper bound on the
       running time for any input. Knowing it provides a guarantee that the algorithm
       will never take any longer. We need not make some educated guess about the
       running time and hope that it never gets much worse.
      For some algorithms, the worst case occurs fairly often. For example, in search-
       ing a database for a particular piece of information, the searching algorithm’s
       worst case will often occur when the information is not present in the database.
       In some applications, searches for absent information may be frequent.
