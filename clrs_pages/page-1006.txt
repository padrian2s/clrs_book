32   String Matching




     Text-editing programs frequently need to ﬁnd all occurrences of a pattern in the
     text. Typically, the text is a document being edited, and the pattern searched for is a
     particular word supplied by the user. Efﬁcient algorithms for this problem—called
     “string matching”—can greatly aid the responsiveness of the text-editing program.
     Among their many other applications, string-matching algorithms search for par-
     ticular patterns in DNA sequences. Internet search engines also use them to ﬁnd
     Web pages relevant to queries.
        We formalize the string-matching problem as follows. We assume that the
     text is an array T Œ1 : : n of length n and that the pattern is an array P Œ1 : : m
     of length m  n. We further assume that the elements of P and T are char-
     acters drawn from a ﬁnite alphabet †. For example, we may have † D f0,1g
     or † D fa; b; : : : ; zg. The character arrays P and T are often called strings of
     characters.
        Referring to Figure 32.1, we say that pattern P occurs with shift s in text T
     (or, equivalently, that pattern P occurs beginning at position s C 1 in text T ) if
     0  s  n  m and T Œs C 1 : : s C m D P Œ1 : : m (that is, if T Œs C j  D P Œj , for
     1  j  m). If P occurs with shift s in T , then we call s a valid shift; otherwise,
     we call s an invalid shift. The string-matching problem is the problem of ﬁnding
     all valid shifts with which a given pattern P occurs in a given text T .


     text T         a b c a b a a b c a b a c

     pattern P                  a b a a


     Figure 32.1 An example of the string-matching problem, where we want to ﬁnd all occurrences of
     the pattern P D abaa in the text T D abcabaabcabac. The pattern occurs only once in the text,
     at shift s D 3, which we call a valid shift. A vertical line connects each character of the pattern to its
     matching character in the text, and all matched characters are shaded.
