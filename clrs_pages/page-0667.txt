      Figure 24.1 Negative edge weights in a directed graph. The shortest-path weight from source s
      appears within each vertex. Because vertices e and f form a negative-weight cycle reachable from s,
      they have shortest-path weights of 1. Because vertex g is reachable from a vertex whose shortest-
      path weight is 1, it, too, has a shortest-path weight of 1. Vertices such as h, i, and j are not
      reachable from s, and so their shortest-path weights are 1, even though they lie on a negative-weight
      cycle.


         Some shortest-paths algorithms, such as Dijkstra’s algorithm, assume that all
      edge weights in the input graph are nonnegative, as in the road-map example. Oth-
      ers, such as the Bellman-Ford algorithm, allow negative-weight edges in the in-
      put graph and produce a correct answer as long as no negative-weight cycles are
      reachable from the source. Typically, if there is such a negative-weight cycle, the
      algorithm can detect and report its existence.

      Cycles
      Can a shortest path contain a cycle? As we have just seen, it cannot contain a
      negative-weight cycle. Nor can it contain a positive-weight cycle, since remov-
      ing the cycle from the path produces a path with the same source and destination
      vertices and a lower path weight. That is, if p D h0 ; 1 ; : : : ; k i is a path and
      c D hi ; i C1 ; : : : ; j i is a positive-weight cycle on this path (so that i D j and
      w.c/ > 0), then the path p 0 D h0 ; 1 ; : : : ; i ; j C1 ; j C2 ; : : : ; k i has weight
      w.p 0 / D w.p/  w.c/ < w.p/, and so p cannot be a shortest path from 0 to k .
         That leaves only 0-weight cycles. We can remove a 0-weight cycle from any
      path to produce another path whose weight is the same. Thus, if there is a shortest
      path from a source vertex s to a destination vertex  that contains a 0-weight cycle,
      then there is another shortest path from s to  without this cycle. As long as a
      shortest path has 0-weight cycles, we can repeatedly remove these cycles from the
      path until we have a shortest path that is cycle-free. Therefore, without loss of
      generality we can assume that when we are ﬁnding shortest paths, they have no
      cycles, i.e., they are simple paths. Since any acyclic path in a graph G D .V; E/
