       Figure 3.1 Graphic examples of the ‚, O, and  notations. In each part, the value of n0 shown
       is the minimum possible value; any greater value would also work. (a) ‚-notation bounds a func-
       tion to within constant factors. We write f .n/ D ‚.g.n// if there exist positive constants n0 , c1 ,
       and c2 such that at and to the right of n0 , the value of f .n/ always lies between c1 g.n/ and c2 g.n/
       inclusive. (b) O-notation gives an upper bound for a function to within a constant factor. We write
       f .n/ D O.g.n// if there are positive constants n0 and c such that at and to the right of n0 , the value
       of f .n/ always lies on or below cg.n/. (c) -notation gives a lower bound for a function to within
       a constant factor. We write f .n/ D .g.n// if there are positive constants n0 and c such that at and
       to the right of n0 , the value of f .n/ always lies on or above cg.n/.


       A function f .n/ belongs to the set ‚.g.n// if there exist positive constants c1
       and c2 such that it can be “sandwiched” between c1 g.n/ and c2 g.n/, for sufﬁ-
       ciently large n. Because ‚.g.n// is a set, we could write “f .n/ 2 ‚.g.n//”
       to indicate that f .n/ is a member of ‚.g.n//. Instead, we will usually write
       “f .n/ D ‚.g.n//” to express the same notion. You might be confused because
       we abuse equality in this way, but we shall see later in this section that doing so
       has its advantages.
          Figure 3.1(a) gives an intuitive picture of functions f .n/ and g.n/, where
       f .n/ D ‚.g.n//. For all values of n at and to the right of n0 , the value of f .n/
       lies at or above c1 g.n/ and at or below c2 g.n/. In other words, for all n  n0 , the
       function f .n/ is equal to g.n/ to within a constant factor. We say that g.n/ is an
       asymptotically tight bound for f .n/.
          The deﬁnition of ‚.g.n// requires that every member f .n/ 2 ‚.g.n// be
       asymptotically nonnegative, that is, that f .n/ be nonnegative whenever n is suf-
       ﬁciently large. (An asymptotically positive function is one that is positive for all
       sufﬁciently large n.) Consequently, the function g.n/ itself must be asymptotically
       nonnegative, or else the set ‚.g.n// is empty. We shall therefore assume that every
       function used within ‚-notation is asymptotically nonnegative. This assumption
       holds for the other asymptotic notations deﬁned in this chapter as well.
