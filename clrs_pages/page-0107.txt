     as long as d  1. As before, we must choose the constant c large enough to handle
     the boundary conditions.
        You might ﬁnd the idea of subtracting a lower-order term counterintuitive. Af-
     ter all, if the math does not work out, we should increase our guess, right?
     Not necessarily! When proving an upper bound by induction, it may actually be
     more difﬁcult to prove that a weaker upper bound holds, because in order to prove
     the weaker bound, we must use the same weaker bound inductively in the proof.
     In our current example, when the recurrence has more than one recursive term, we
     get to subtract out the lower-order term of the proposed bound once per recursive
     term. In the above example, we subtracted out the constant d twice, once for the
     T .bn=2c/ term and once for the T .dn=2e/ term. We ended up with the inequality
     T .n/  cn  2d C 1, and it was easy to ﬁnd values of d to make cn  2d C 1 be
     less than or equal to cn  d .

     Avoiding pitfalls
     It is easy to err in the use of asymptotic notation. For example, in the recur-
     rence (4.19) we can falsely “prove” T .n/ D O.n/ by guessing T .n/  cn and
     then arguing
     T .n/  2.c bn=2c/ C n
            cn C n
           D O.n/ ;                 wrong!!
     since c is a constant. The error is that we have not proved the exact form of the
     inductive hypothesis, that is, that T .n/  cn. We therefore will explicitly prove
     that T .n/  cn when we want to show that T .n/ D O.n/.

     Changing variables
     Sometimes, a little algebraic manipulation can make an unknown recurrence simi-
     lar to one you have seen before. As an example, consider the recurrence
                    p ˘
     T .n/ D 2T       n C lg n ;
     which looks difﬁcult. We can simplify this recurrence, though, with a change of
     variables.
        p       For convenience, we shall not worry about rounding off values, such
     as n, to be integers. Renaming m D lg n yields
     T .2m / D 2T .2m=2 / C m :
     We can now rename S.m/ D T .2m / to produce the new recurrence
     S.m/ D 2S.m=2/ C m ;
