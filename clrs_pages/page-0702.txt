Problems for Chapter 24                                                            681


Let  D minc .c/, where c ranges over all directed cycles in G. We call a cycle c
for which .c/ D  a minimum mean-weight cycle. This problem investigates
an efﬁcient algorithm for computing  .
   Assume without loss of generality that every vertex  2 V is reachable from a
source vertex s 2 V . Let ı.s; / be the weight of a shortest path from s to , and let
ık .s; / be the weight of a shortest path from s to  consisting of exactly k edges.
If there is no path from s to  with exactly k edges, then ık .s; / D 1.
a. Show that if  D 0, then G contains no negative-weight cycles and ı.s; / D
   min0kn1 ık .s; / for all vertices  2 V .
                    
b. Show that if         D 0, then
           ın .s; /  ık .s; /
     max                         0
   0kn1         nk
   for all vertices  2 V . (Hint: Use both properties from part (a).)

c. Let c be a 0-weight cycle, and let u and  be any two vertices on c. Suppose
   that  D 0 and that the weight of the simple path from u to  along the cycle
   is x. Prove that ı.s; / D ı.s; u/ C x. (Hint: The weight of the simple path
   from  to u along the cycle is x.)

d. Show that if  D 0, then on each minimum mean-weight cycle there exists a
   vertex  such that
           ın .s; /  ık .s; /
     max                         D0:
   0kn1         nk
   (Hint: Show how to extend a shortest path to any vertex on a minimum mean-
   weight cycle along the cycle to make a shortest path to the next vertex on the
   cycle.)
                    
e. Show that if         D 0, then
                ın .s; /  ık .s; /
   min max                            D0:

                                                                                     
f. Show that if we add a constant t to the weight of each edge of G, then
   increases by t. Use this fact to show that

                         ın .s; /  ık .s; /
         D min max                              :
           2V 0kn1            nk
                                                    
