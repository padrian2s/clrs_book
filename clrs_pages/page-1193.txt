       The subgraph induced by the vertex set f1; 2; 3; 6g in Figure B.2(a) appears in
       Figure B.2(c) and has the edge set f.1; 2/; .2; 2/; .6; 3/g.
          Given an undirected graph G D .V; E/, the directed version of G is the directed
       graph G 0 D .V; E 0 /, where .u; / 2 E 0 if and only if .u; / 2 E. That is, we
       replace each undirected edge .u; / in G by the two directed edges .u; / and .; u/
       in the directed version. Given a directed graph G D .V; E/, the undirected version
       of G is the undirected graph G 0 D .V; E 0 /, where .u; / 2 E 0 if and only if u ¤ 
       and .u; / 2 E. That is, the undirected version contains the edges of G “with
       their directions removed” and with self-loops eliminated. (Since .u; / and .; u/
       are the same edge in an undirected graph, the undirected version of a directed
       graph contains it only once, even if the directed graph contains both edges .u; /
       and .; u/.) In a directed graph G D .V; E/, a neighbor of a vertex u is any vertex
       that is adjacent to u in the undirected version of G. That is,  is a neighbor of u if
       u ¤  and either .u; / 2 E or .; u/ 2 E. In an undirected graph, u and  are
       neighbors if they are adjacent.
          Several kinds of graphs have special names. A complete graph is an undirected
       graph in which every pair of vertices is adjacent. A bipartite graph is an undirected
       graph G D .V; E/ in which V can be partitioned into two sets V1 and V2 such that
       .u; / 2 E implies either u 2 V1 and  2 V2 or u 2 V2 and  2 V1 . That is, all
       edges go between the two sets V1 and V2 . An acyclic, undirected graph is a forest,
       and a connected, acyclic, undirected graph is a (free) tree (see Section B.5). We
       often take the ﬁrst letters of “directed acyclic graph” and call such a graph a dag.
          There are two variants of graphs that you may occasionally encounter. A multi-
       graph is like an undirected graph, but it can have both multiple edges between ver-
       tices and self-loops. A hypergraph is like an undirected graph, but each hyperedge,
       rather than connecting two vertices, connects an arbitrary subset of vertices. Many
       algorithms written for ordinary directed and undirected graphs can be adapted to
       run on these graphlike structures.
          The contraction of an undirected graph G D .V; E/ by an edge e D .u; / is a
       graph G 0 D .V 0 ; E 0 /, where V 0 D V  fu; g [ fxg and x is a new vertex. The set
       of edges E 0 is formed from E by deleting the edge .u; / and, for each vertex w
       incident on u or , deleting whichever of .u; w/ and .; w/ is in E and adding the
       new edge .x; w/. In effect, u and  are “contracted” into a single vertex.

       Exercises

       B.4-1
       Attendees of a faculty party shake hands to greet each other, and each professor
       remembers how many times he or she shook hands. At the end of the party, the
       department head adds up the number of times that each professor shook hands.
