      Then, to produce an optimal dual solution, we set
            (
                 0
              cnCi  if .n C i/ 2 N ;
      yNi D                                                                             (29.91)
              0      otherwise :

         Thus, an optimal solution to the dual linear program deﬁned in (29.86)–(29.90)
      is yN1 D 0 (since n C 1 D 4 2 B), yN2 D c50 D 1=6, and yN3 D c60 D 2=3.
      Evaluating the dual objective function (29.86), we obtain an objective value of
      .30  0/ C .24  .1=6// C .36  .2=3// D 28, which conﬁrms that the objective value
      of the primal is indeed equal to the objective value of the dual. Combining these
      calculations with Lemma 29.8 yields a proof that the optimal objective value of the
      primal linear program is 28. We now show that this approach applies in general:
      we can ﬁnd an optimal solution to the dual and simultaneously prove that a solution
      to the primal is optimal.

      Theorem 29.10 (Linear-programming duality)
      Suppose that S IMPLEX returns values xN D .xN 1 ; xN 2 ; : : : ; xN n / for the primal lin-
      ear program .A; b; c/. Let N and B denote the nonbasic and basic variables for
      the ﬁnal slack form, let c 0 denote the coefﬁcients in the ﬁnal slack form, and let
      yN D .yN1 ; yN2 ; : : : ; yNm / be deﬁned by equation (29.91). Then xN is an optimal so-
      lution to the primal linear program, yN is an optimal solution to the dual linear
      program, and
      X
      n                 X
                        m
             cj xNj D          bi yNi :                                                 (29.92)
      j D1              i D1



      Proof By Corollary 29.9, if we can ﬁnd feasible solutions xN and yN that satisfy
      equation (29.92), then xN and yN must be optimal primal and dual solutions. We
      shall now show that the solutions xN and yN described in the statement of the theorem
      satisfy equation (29.92).
         Suppose that we run S IMPLEX on a primal linear program, as given in lines
      (29.16)–(29.18). The algorithm proceeds through a series of slack forms until it
      terminates with a ﬁnal slack form with objective function
                X
      ´ D 0 C       cj0 xj :                                                        (29.93)
                   j 2N

      Since S IMPLEX terminated with a solution, by the condition in line 3 we know that
      cj0  0 for all j 2 N :                                                           (29.94)
