50   Chapter 3 Growth of Functions


     there is only a single anonymous function (a function of i). This expression is thus
     not the same as O.1/ C O.2/ C    C O.n/, which doesn’t really have a clean
     interpretation.
        In some cases, asymptotic notation appears on the left-hand side of an equation,
     as in
     2n2 C ‚.n/ D ‚.n2 / :
     We interpret such equations using the following rule: No matter how the anony-
     mous functions are chosen on the left of the equal sign, there is a way to choose
     the anonymous functions on the right of the equal sign to make the equation valid.
     Thus, our example means that for any function f .n/ 2 ‚.n/, there is some func-
     tion g.n/ 2 ‚.n2 / such that 2n2 C f .n/ D g.n/ for all n. In other words, the
     right-hand side of an equation provides a coarser level of detail than the left-hand
     side.
        We can chain together a number of such relationships, as in
     2n2 C 3n C 1 D 2n2 C ‚.n/
                  D ‚.n2 / :
     We can interpret each equation separately by the rules above. The ﬁrst equa-
     tion says that there is some function f .n/ 2 ‚.n/ such that 2n2 C 3n C 1 D
     2n2 C f .n/ for all n. The second equation says that for any function g.n/ 2 ‚.n/
     (such as the f .n/ just mentioned), there is some function h.n/ 2 ‚.n2 / such
     that 2n2 C g.n/ D h.n/ for all n. Note that this interpretation implies that
     2n2 C 3n C 1 D ‚.n2 /, which is what the chaining of equations intuitively gives
     us.

     o-notation
     The asymptotic upper bound provided by O-notation may or may not be asymp-
     totically tight. The bound 2n2 D O.n2 / is asymptotically tight, but the bound
     2n D O.n2 / is not. We use o-notation to denote an upper bound that is not asymp-
     totically tight. We formally deﬁne o.g.n// (“little-oh of g of n”) as the set
     o.g.n// D ff .n/ W for any positive constant c > 0, there exists a constant
                        n0 > 0 such that 0  f .n/ < cg.n/ for all n  n0 g :
     For example, 2n D o.n2 /, but 2n2 ¤ o.n2 /.
        The deﬁnitions of O-notation and o-notation are similar. The main difference
     is that in f .n/ D O.g.n//, the bound 0  f .n/  cg.n/ holds for some con-
     stant c > 0, but in f .n/ D o.g.n//, the bound 0  f .n/ < cg.n/ holds for all
     constants c > 0. Intuitively, in o-notation, the function f .n/ becomes insigniﬁcant
     relative to g.n/ as n approaches inﬁnity; that is,
