914   Chapter 30 Polynomials and the FFT


      Theorem 30.8 (Convolution theorem)
      For any two vectors a and b of length n, where n is a power of 2,
      a ˝ b D DFT1
                 2n .DFT2n .a/  DFT2n .b// ;

      where the vectors a and b are padded with 0s to length 2n and  denotes the com-
      ponentwise product of two 2n-element vectors.

      Write pseudocode to compute DFT1
                                     n in ‚.n lg n/ time.

      30.2-5
      Describe the generalization of the FFT procedure to the case in which n is a power
      of 3. Give a recurrence for the running time, and solve the recurrence.

      30.2-6 ?
      Suppose that instead of performing an n-element FFT over the ﬁeld of complex
      numbers (where n is even), we use the ring Zm of integers modulo m, where
      m D 2t n=2 C 1 and t is an arbitrary positive integer. Use ! D 2t instead of !n
      as a principal nth root of unity, modulo m. Prove that the DFT and the inverse DFT
      are well deﬁned in this system.

      30.2-7
      Given a list of values ´0 ; ´1 ; : : : ; ´n1 (possibly with repetitions), show how to ﬁnd
      the coefﬁcients of a polynomial P .x/ of degree-bound n C 1 that has zeros only
      at ´0 ; ´1 ; : : : ; ´n1 (possibly with repetitions). Your procedure should run in time
      O.n lg2 n/. (Hint: The polynomial P .x/ has a zero at ´j if and only if P .x/ is a
      multiple of .x  ´j /.)
