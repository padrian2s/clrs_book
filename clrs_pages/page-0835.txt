      A solution to the equations (28.1) is a set of values for x1 ; x2 ; : : : ; xn that satisfy
      all of the equations simultaneously. In this section, we treat only the case in which
      there are exactly n equations in n unknowns.

         We can conveniently rewrite equations (28.1) as the matrix-vector equation

           11                          1            1
         a21    a22      a2n       x2           b2
          ::     ::   ::     ::        ::   D       ::
           :      :       :   :         :            :

      or, equivalently, letting A D .aij /, x D .xi /, and b D .bi /, as
      Ax D b :                                                                            (28.2)
        If A is nonsingular, it possesses an inverse A1 , and
      x D A1 b                                                                           (28.3)
      is the solution vector. We can prove that x is the unique solution to equation (28.2)
      as follows. If there are two solutions, x and x 0 , then Ax D Ax 0 D b and, letting I
      denote an identity matrix,
      x D       Ix
        D       .A1 A/x
        D       A1 .Ax/
        D       A1 .Ax 0 /
        D       .A1 A/x 0
        D       x0 :
         In this section, we shall be concerned predominantly with the case in which A
      is nonsingular or, equivalently (by Theorem D.1), the rank of A is equal to the
      number n of unknowns. There are other possibilities, however, which merit a brief
      discussion. If the number of equations is less than the number n of unknowns—or,
      more generally, if the rank of A is less than n—then the system is underdeter-
      mined. An underdetermined system typically has inﬁnitely many solutions, al-
      though it may have no solutions at all if the equations are inconsistent. If the
      number of equations exceeds the number n of unknowns, the system is overdeter-
      mined, and there may not exist any solutions. Section 28.3 addresses the important
