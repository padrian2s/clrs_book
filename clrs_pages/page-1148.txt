Combining inequalities (35.21) and (35.22) gives
w.C /  2´  2w.C  / ;
and hence A PPROX -M IN -W EIGHT-VC is a 2-approximation algorithm.

Exercises

35.4-1
Show that even if we allow a clause to contain both a variable and its negation, ran-
domly setting each variable to 1 with probability 1=2 and to 0 with probability 1=2
still yields a randomized 8=7-approximation algorithm.

35.4-2
The MAX-CNF satisﬁability problem is like the MAX-3-CNF satisﬁability prob-
lem, except that it does not restrict each clause to have exactly 3 literals. Give a
randomized 2-approximation algorithm for the MAX-CNF satisﬁability problem.

35.4-3
In the MAX-CUT problem, we are given an unweighted undirected graph G D
.V; E/. We deﬁne a cut .S; V  S/ as in Chapter 23 and the weight of a cut as the
number of edges crossing the cut. The goal is to ﬁnd a cut of maximum weight.
Suppose that for each vertex , we randomly and independently place  in S with
probability 1=2 and in V  S with probability 1=2. Show that this algorithm is a
randomized 2-approximation algorithm.
