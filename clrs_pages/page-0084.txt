b. Describe the potential advantages and disadvantages of using  instead of  to
   characterize the running times of programs.

Some authors also deﬁne O in a slightly different manner; let’s use O 0 for the
alternative deﬁnition. We say that f .n/ D O 0 .g.n// if and only if jf .n/j D
O.g.n//.

c. What happens to each direction of the “if and only if” in Theorem 3.1 if we
   substitute O 0 for O but still use ?

Some authors deﬁne Oe (read “soft-oh”) to mean O with logarithmic factors ig-
nored:
e
O.g.n// D ff .n/ W there exist positive constants c, k, and n0 such that
                   0  f .n/  cg.n/ lgk .n/ for all n  n0 g :

d. Deﬁne e and ‚
                e in a similar manner. Prove the corresponding analog to Theo-
   rem 3.1.

3-6 Iterated functions
We can apply the iteration operator  used in the lg function to any monotonically
increasing function f .n/ over the reals. For a given constant c 2 R, we deﬁne the
iterated function fc by
               ˚
fc .n/ D min i  0 W f .i / .n/  c ;
which need not be well deﬁned in all cases. In other words, the quantity fc .n/ is
the number of iterated applications of the function f required to reduce its argu-
ment down to c or less.
   For each of the following functions f .n/ and constants c, give as tight a bound
as possible on fc .n/.
      f .n/       c         fc .n/
