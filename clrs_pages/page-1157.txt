       d. Consider a maximal matching M in G D .V; E/. Let
          T D f 2 V W some edge in M is incident on g :
          What can you say about the subgraph of G induced by the vertices of G that
          are not in T ?

       e. Conclude from part (d) that 2 jM j is the size of a vertex cover for G.

       f. Using parts (c) and (e), prove that the greedy algorithm in part (b) is a 2-approx-
          imation algorithm for maximum matching.

       35-5 Parallel machine scheduling
       In the parallel-machine-scheduling problem, we are given n jobs, J1 ; J2 ; : : : ; Jn ,
       where each job Jk has an associated nonnegative processing time of pk . We are
       also given m identical machines, M1 ; M2 ; : : : ; Mm . Any job can run on any ma-
       chine. A schedule speciﬁes, for each job Jk , the machine on which it runs and
       the time period during which it runs. Each job Jk must run on some machine Mi
       for pk consecutive time units, and during that time period no other job may run
       on Mi . Let Ck denote the completion time of job Jk , that is, the time at which
       job Jk completes processing. Given a schedule, we deﬁne Cmax D max1j n Cj to
       be the makespan of the schedule. The goal is to ﬁnd a schedule whose makespan
       is minimum.
          For example, suppose that we have two machines M1 and M2 and that we have
       four jobs J1 ; J2 ; J3 ; J4 , with p1 D 2, p2 D 12, p3 D 4, and p4 D 5. Then one
       possible schedule runs, on machine M1 , job J1 followed by job J2 , and on ma-
       chine M2 , it runs job J4 followed by job J3 . For this schedule, C1 D 2, C2 D 14,
       C3 D 9, C4 D 5, and Cmax D 14. An optimal schedule runs J2 on machine M1 , and
       it runs jobs J1 , J3 , and J4 on machine M2 . For this schedule, C1 D 2, C2 D 12,
       C3 D 6, C4 D 11, and Cmax D 12.
                                                                   
          Given a parallel-machine-scheduling problem, we let Cmax    denote the makespan
       of an optimal schedule.
       a. Show that the optimal makespan is at least as large as the greatest processing
          time, that is,
           
          Cmax  max pk :
                  1kn

       b. Show that the optimal makespan is at least as large as the average machine load,
          that is,
                  1 X
          Cmax            pk :
                   m
                      1kn
