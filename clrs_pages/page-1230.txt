C.5 The tails of the binomial distribution                                        1209


   The following corollary restates the theorem for the left tail of the binomial
distribution. In general, we shall leave it to you to adapt the proofs from one tail to
the other.

Corollary C.3
Consider a sequence of n Bernoulli trials, where success occurs with probabil-
ity p. If X is the random variable denoting the total number of successes, then for
0  k  n, the probability of at most k successes is
                     X
                     k
Pr fX  kg D                b.iI n; p/
                     i D0
                              !
                         n
                               .1  p/nk
                       nk
                         !
                       n
                D          .1  p/nk :
                       k

  Our next bound concerns the left tail of the binomial distribution. Its corollary
shows that, far from the mean, the left tail diminishes exponentially.

Theorem C.4
Consider a sequence of n Bernoulli trials, where success occurs with probability p
and failure with probability q D 1  p. Let X be the random variable denoting the
total number of successes. Then for 0 < k < np, the probability of fewer than k
successes is
                   X
                   k1
Pr fX < kg D           b.iI n; p/
                     i D0
                        kq
                <            b.kI n; p/ :
                      np  k
                            Pk1
Proof We bound the series i D0 b.iI n; p/ by a geometric series using the tech-
nique from Section A.2, page 1151. For i D 1; 2; : : : ; k, we have from equa-
tion (C.41),
