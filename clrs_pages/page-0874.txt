    Next, we show how to convert a linear program in which some of the variables
do not have nonnegativity constraints into one in which each variable has a non-
negativity constraint. Suppose that some variable xj does not have a nonnegativity
constraint. Then, we replace each occurrence of xj by xj0  xj00 , and add the non-
negativity constraints xj0  0 and xj00  0. Thus, if the objective function has a
term cj xj , we replace it by cj xj0  cj xj00 , and if constraint i has a term aij xj , we
replace it by aij xj0  aij xj00 . Any feasible solution xy to the new linear program cor-
responds to a feasible solution xN to the original linear program with xNj D xyj0  xyj00
and with the same objective value. Also, any feasible solution xN to the original
linear program corresponds to a feasible solution xy to the new linear program with
xyj0 D xNj and xyj00 D 0 if xNj  0, or with xyj00 D xNj and xyj0 D 0 if xNj < 0. The two
linear programs have the same objective value regardless of the sign of xNj . Thus,
the two linear programs are equivalent. We apply this conversion scheme to each
variable that does not have a nonnegativity constraint to yield an equivalent linear
program in which all variables have nonnegativity constraints.
    Continuing the example, we want to ensure that each variable has a correspond-
ing nonnegativity constraint. Variable x1 has such a constraint, but variable x2 does
not. Therefore, we replace x2 by two variables x20 and x200 , and we modify the linear
program to obtain

subject to
                x1 C x20             x200     D 7                                    (29.22)
                x1  2x20           C 2x200     4

   Next, we convert equality constraints into inequality constraints. Suppose that a
linear program has an equality constraint f .x1 ; x2 ; : : : ; xn / D b. Since x D y if
and only if both x  y and x  y, we can replace this equality constraint by the
pair of inequality constraints f .x1 ; x2 ; : : : ; xn /  b and f .x1 ; x2 ; : : : ; xn /  b.
Repeating this conversion for each equality constraint yields a linear program in
which all constraints are inequalities.
   Finally, we can convert the greater-than-or-equal-to constraints to less-than-or-
equal-to constraints by multiplying these constraints through by 1. That is, any
inequality of the form
