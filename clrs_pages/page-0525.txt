           how to implement these operations on 2-3-4 trees. We assume for convenience that
           elements consist only of keys and that all key values are distinct.

           a. Show how to maintain, for every node x of a 2-3-4 tree, the height of the subtree
              rooted at x as an attribute x:height. Make sure that your implementation does
              not affect the asymptotic running times of searching, insertion, and deletion.

           b. Show how to implement the join operation. Given two 2-3-4 trees T 0 and T 00
              and a key k, the join operation should run in O.1 C jh0  h00 j/ time, where h0
              and h00 are the heights of T 0 and T 00 , respectively.

           c. Consider the simple path p from the root of a 2-3-4 tree T to a given key k,
              the set S 0 of keys in T that are less than k, and the set S 00 of keys in T that are
              greater than k. Show that p breaks S 0 into a set of trees fT00 ; T10 ; : : : ; Tm0 g and a
              set of keys fk10 ; k20 ; : : : ; km
                                                0
                                                  g, where, for i D 1; 2; : : : ; m, we have y < ki0 < ´
              for any keys y 2 Ti 1 and ´ 2 Ti0 . What is the relationship between the heights
                                      0

              of Ti01 and Ti0 ? Describe how p breaks S 00 into sets of trees and keys.

           d. Show how to implement the split operation on T . Use the join operation to
              assemble the keys in S 0 into a single 2-3-4 tree T 0 and the keys in S 00 into a
              single 2-3-4 tree T 00 . The running time of the split operation should be O.lg n/,
              where n is the number of keys in T . (Hint: The costs for joining should tele-
              scope.)


Chapter notes

           Knuth [211], Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman [5], and Sedgewick [306] give further
           discussions of balanced-tree schemes and B-trees. Comer [74] provides a compre-
           hensive survey of B-trees. Guibas and Sedgewick [155] discuss the relationships
           among various kinds of balanced-tree schemes, including red-black trees and 2-3-4
           trees.
              In 1970, J. E. Hopcroft invented 2-3 trees, a precursor to B-trees and 2-3-4
           trees, in which every internal node has either two or three children. Bayer and
           McCreight [35] introduced B-trees in 1972; they did not explain their choice of
           name.
              Bender, Demaine, and Farach-Colton [40] studied how to make B-trees perform
           well in the presence of memory-hierarchy effects. Their cache-oblivious algo-
           rithms work efﬁciently without explicitly knowing the data transfer sizes within
           the memory hierarchy.
