Notice that we have two “insertion” procedures here: the TABLE -I NSERT proce-
dure itself and the elementary insertion into a table in lines 6 and 10. We can
analyze the running time of TABLE -I NSERT in terms of the number of elementary
insertions by assigning a cost of 1 to each elementary insertion. We assume that
the actual running time of TABLE -I NSERT is linear in the time to insert individual
items, so that the overhead for allocating an initial table in line 2 is constant and
the overhead for allocating and freeing storage in lines 5 and 7 is dominated by
the cost of transferring items in line 6. We call the event in which lines 5–9 are
executed an expansion.
   Let us analyze a sequence of n TABLE -I NSERT operations on an initially empty
table. What is the cost ci of the ith operation? If the current table has room for the
new item (or if this is the ﬁrst operation), then ci D 1, since we need only perform
the one elementary insertion in line 10. If the current table is full, however, and an
expansion occurs, then ci D i: the cost is 1 for the elementary insertion in line 10
plus i  1 for the items that we must copy from the old table to the new table in
line 6. If we perform n operations, the worst-case cost of an operation is O.n/,
which leads to an upper bound of O.n2 / on the total running time for n operations.
   This bound is not tight, because we rarely expand the table in the course of n
TABLE -I NSERT operations. Speciﬁcally, the ith operation causes an expansion
only when i  1 is an exact power of 2. The amortized cost of an operation is in
fact O.1/, as we can show using aggregate analysis. The cost of the ith operation
is
      (
        i if i  1 is an exact power of 2 ;
ci D
        1 otherwise :
The total cost of n TABLE -I NSERT operations is therefore

i D1               j D0
            < n C 2n
            D 3n ;
because at most n operations cost 1 and the costs of the remaining operations form
a geometric series. Since the total cost of n TABLE -I NSERT operations is bounded
by 3n, the amortized cost of a single operation is at most 3.
   By using the accounting method, we can gain some feeling for why the amor-
tized cost of a TABLE -I NSERT operation should be 3. Intuitively, each item pays
for 3 elementary insertions: inserting itself into the current table, moving itself
when the table expands, and moving another item that has already been moved
once when the table expands. For example, suppose that the size of the table is m
immediately after an expansion. Then the table holds m=2 items, and it contains
