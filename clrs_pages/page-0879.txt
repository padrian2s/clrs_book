858   Chapter 29 Linear Programming


      29.1-5
      Convert the following linear program into slack form:
      maximize     2x1                 6x3
      subject to
                    x1 C x2              x3      7
                   3x1  x2                       8
                   x1 C 2x2          C 2x3       0
                      x1 ; x2 ; x3                0 :
      What are the basic and nonbasic variables?

      29.1-6
      Show that the following linear program is infeasible:
      maximize      3x1     2x2
      subject to
                     x1 C x2             2
                   2x1  2x2          10
                       x1 ; x2           0 :

      29.1-7
      Show that the following linear program is unbounded:
      maximize        x1       x2
      subject to
                   2x1 C x2           1
                    x1  2x2          2
                       x1 ; x2          0 :

      29.1-8
      Suppose that we have a general linear program with n variables and m constraints,
      and suppose that we convert it into standard form. Give an upper bound on the
      number of variables and constraints in the resulting linear program.

      29.1-9
      Give an example of a linear program for which the feasible region is not bounded,
      but the optimal objective value is ﬁnite.
