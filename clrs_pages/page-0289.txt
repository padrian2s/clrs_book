      values r and s modulo p; there are no collisions yet at the “mod p level.” Moreover,
      each of the possible p.p1/ choices for the pair .a; b/ with a ¤ 0 yields a different
      resulting pair .r; s/ with r ¤ s, since we can solve for a and b given r and s:
      a D .r  s/..k  l/1 mod p/ mod p ;
      b D .r  ak/ mod p ;
      where ..k  l/1 mod p/ denotes the unique multiplicative inverse, modulo p,
      of k  l. Since there are only p.p  1/ possible pairs .r; s/ with r ¤ s, there
      is a one-to-one correspondence between pairs .a; b/ with a ¤ 0 and pairs .r; s/
      with r ¤ s. Thus, for any given pair of inputs k and l, if we pick .a; b/ uniformly
      at random from Zp Zp , the resulting pair .r; s/ is equally likely to be any pair of
      distinct values modulo p.
         Therefore, the probability that distinct keys k and l collide is equal to the prob-
      ability that r  s .mod m/ when r and s are randomly chosen as distinct values
      modulo p. For a given value of r, of the p  1 possible remaining values for s, the
      number of values s such that s ¤ r and s  r .mod m/ is at most
      dp=me  1  ..p C m  1/=m/  1 (by inequality (3.6))
                D .p  1/=m :
      The probability that s collides with r when reduced modulo m is at most
      ..p  1/=m/=.p  1/ D 1=m.
        Therefore, for any pair of distinct values k; l 2 Zp ,
      Pr fhab .k/ D hab .l/g  1=m ;
      so that Hpm is indeed universal.


      Exercises

      11.3-1
      Suppose we wish to search a linked list of length n, where each element contains
      a key k along with a hash value h.k/. Each key is a long character string. How
      might we take advantage of the hash values when searching the list for an element
      with a given key?

      11.3-2
      Suppose that we hash a string of r characters into m slots by treating it as a
      radix-128 number and then using the division method. We can easily represent
      the number m as a 32-bit computer word, but the string of r characters, treated as
      a radix-128 number, takes many words. How can we apply the division method to
      compute the hash value of the character string without using more than a constant
      number of words of storage outside the string itself?
