            28.2-2
            Let M.n/ be the time to multiply two n n matrices, and let L.n/ be the time to
            compute the LUP decomposition of an n n matrix. Show that multiplying matri-
            ces and computing LUP decompositions of matrices have essentially the same dif-
            ﬁculty: an M.n/-time matrix-multiplication algorithm implies an O.M.n//-time
            LUP-decomposition algorithm, and an L.n/-time LUP-decomposition algorithm
            implies an O.L.n//-time matrix-multiplication algorithm.

            28.2-3
            Let M.n/ be the time to multiply two n n matrices, and let D.n/ denote the
            time required to ﬁnd the determinant of an n n matrix. Show that multiply-
            ing matrices and computing the determinant have essentially the same difﬁculty:
            an M.n/-time matrix-multiplication algorithm implies an O.M.n//-time determi-
            nant algorithm, and a D.n/-time determinant algorithm implies an O.D.n//-time
            matrix-multiplication algorithm.

            28.2-4
            Let M.n/ be the time to multiply two n n boolean matrices, and let T .n/ be the
            time to ﬁnd the transitive closure of an n n boolean matrix. (See Section 25.2.)
            Show that an M.n/-time boolean matrix-multiplication algorithm implies an
            O.M.n/ lg n/-time transitive-closure algorithm, and a T .n/-time transitive-closure
            algorithm implies an O.T .n//-time boolean matrix-multiplication algorithm.

            28.2-5
            Does the matrix-inversion algorithm based on Theorem 28.2 work when matrix
            elements are drawn from the ﬁeld of integers modulo 2? Explain.

            28.2-6 ?
            Generalize the matrix-inversion algorithm of Theorem 28.2 to handle matrices of
            complex numbers, and prove that your generalization works correctly. (Hint: In-
            stead of the transpose of A, use the conjugate transpose A , which you obtain from
            the transpose of A by replacing every entry with its complex conjugate. Instead of
            symmetric matrices, consider Hermitian matrices, which are matrices A such that
            A D A .)



28.3 Symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrices and least-squares approximation

            Symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrices have many interesting and desirable proper-
            ties. For example, they are nonsingular, and we can perform LU decomposition
            on them without having to worry about dividing by 0. In this section, we shall
