666   Chapter 24 Single-Source Shortest Paths


      One solution to this problem is x D .5; 3; 0; 1; 4/, which you can verify di-
      rectly by checking each inequality. In fact, this problem has more than one solution.
      Another is x 0 D .0; 2; 5; 4; 1/. These two solutions are related: each component
      of x 0 is 5 larger than the corresponding component of x. This fact is not mere
      coincidence.

      Lemma 24.8
      Let x D .x1 ; x2 ; : : : ; xn / be a solution to a system Ax  b of difference con-
      straints, and let d be any constant. Then x C d D .x1 C d; x2 C d; : : : ; xn C d /
      is a solution to Ax  b as well.

      Proof For each xi and xj , we have .xj C d /  .xi C d / D xj  xi . Thus, if x
      satisﬁes Ax  b, so does x C d .

         Systems of difference constraints occur in many different applications. For ex-
      ample, the unknowns xi may be times at which events are to occur. Each constraint
      states that at least a certain amount of time, or at most a certain amount of time,
      must elapse between two events. Perhaps the events are jobs to be performed dur-
      ing the assembly of a product. If we apply an adhesive that takes 2 hours to set at
      time x1 and we have to wait until it sets to install a part at time x2 , then we have the
      constraint that x2  x1 C 2 or, equivalently, that x1  x2  2. Alternatively, we
      might require that the part be installed after the adhesive has been applied but no
      later than the time that the adhesive has set halfway. In this case, we get the pair of
      constraints x2  x1 and x2  x1 C 1 or, equivalently, x1  x2  0 and x2  x1  1.

      Constraint graphs
      We can interpret systems of difference constraints from a graph-theoretic point
      of view. In a system Ax  b of difference constraints, we view the m n
      linear-programming matrix A as the transpose of an incidence matrix (see Exer-
      cise 22.1-7) for a graph with n vertices and m edges. Each vertex i in the graph,
      for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n, corresponds to one of the n unknown variables xi . Each di-
      rected edge in the graph corresponds to one of the m inequalities involving two
      unknowns.
         More formally, given a system Ax  b of difference constraints, the correspond-
      ing constraint graph is a weighted, directed graph G D .V; E/, where
      V D f0 ; 1 ; : : : ; n g
      and
      E D f.i ; j / W xj  xi  bk is a constraintg
