            Show that the set of odd natural numbers is countable.

            Show that for any ﬁnite set S, the power set 2S has 2jSj elements (that is, there
            are 2jSj distinct subsets of S).

            B.1-6
            Give an inductive deﬁnition for an n-tuple by extending the set-theoretic deﬁnition
            for an ordered pair.



B.2   Relations

            A binary relation R on two sets A and B is a subset of the Cartesian product A B.
            If .a; b/ 2 R, we sometimes write a R b. When we say that R is a binary relation
            on a set A, we mean that R is a subset of A A. For example, the “less than”
            relation on the natural numbers is the set f.a; b/ W a; b 2 N and a < bg. An n-ary
            relation on sets A1 ; A2 ; : : : ; An is a subset of A1 A2    An .
               A binary relation R  A A is reﬂexive if
            aRa
            for all a 2 A. For example, “D” and “” are reﬂexive relations on N, but “<” is
            not. The relation R is symmetric if
            a R b implies b R a
            for all a; b 2 A. For example, “D” is symmetric, but “<” and “” are not. The
            relation R is transitive if
            a R b and b R c imply a R c
