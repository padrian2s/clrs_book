      The system of constraints (29.59)–(29.61) has 3 equations and 6 variables. Any
      setting of the variables x1 , x2 , and x3 deﬁnes values for x4 , x5 , and x6 ; therefore,
      we have an inﬁnite number of solutions to this system of equations. A solution is
      feasible if all of x1 ; x2 ; : : : ; x6 are nonnegative, and there can be an inﬁnite num-
      ber of feasible solutions as well. The inﬁnite number of possible solutions to a
      system such as this one will be useful in later proofs. We focus on the basic solu-
      tion: set all the (nonbasic) variables on the right-hand side to 0 and then compute
      the values of the (basic) variables on the left-hand side. In this example, the ba-
      sic solution is .xN 1 ; xN 2 ; : : : ; xN 6 / D .0; 0; 0; 30; 24; 36/ and it has objective value
      ´ D .3  0/ C .1  0/ C .2  0/ D 0. Observe that this basic solution sets xN i D bi
      for each i 2 B. An iteration of the simplex algorithm rewrites the set of equations
      and the objective function so as to put a different set of variables on the right-
      hand side. Thus, a different basic solution is associated with the rewritten problem.
      We emphasize that the rewrite does not in any way change the underlying linear-
      programming problem; the problem at one iteration has the identical set of feasible
      solutions as the problem at the previous iteration. The problem does, however,
      have a different basic solution than that of the previous iteration.
         If a basic solution is also feasible, we call it a basic feasible solution. As we run
      the simplex algorithm, the basic solution is almost always a basic feasible solution.
      We shall see in Section 29.5, however, that for the ﬁrst few iterations of the simplex
      algorithm, the basic solution might not be feasible.
         Our goal, in each iteration, is to reformulate the linear program so that the basic
      solution has a greater objective value. We select a nonbasic variable xe whose
      coefﬁcient in the objective function is positive, and we increase the value of xe as
      much as possible without violating any of the constraints. The variable xe becomes
      basic, and some other variable xl becomes nonbasic. The values of other basic
      variables and of the objective function may also change.
         To continue the example, let’s think about increasing the value of x1 . As we
      increase x1 , the values of x4 , x5 , and x6 all decrease. Because we have a nonnega-
      tivity constraint for each variable, we cannot allow any of them to become negative.
      If x1 increases above 30, then x4 becomes negative, and x5 and x6 become nega-
      tive when x1 increases above 12 and 9, respectively. The third constraint (29.61) is
      the tightest constraint, and it limits how much we can increase x1 . Therefore, we
      switch the roles of x1 and x6 . We solve equation (29.61) for x1 and obtain
                  x2 x3 x6
      x1 D 9                          :                                                     (29.62)
