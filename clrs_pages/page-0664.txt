24   Single-Source Shortest Paths




     Professor Patrick wishes to ﬁnd the shortest possible route from Phoenix to Indi-
     anapolis. Given a road map of the United States on which the distance between
     each pair of adjacent intersections is marked, how can she determine this shortest
     route?
        One possible way would be to enumerate all the routes from Phoenix to Indi-
     anapolis, add up the distances on each route, and select the shortest. It is easy to
     see, however, that even disallowing routes that contain cycles, Professor Patrick
     would have to examine an enormous number of possibilities, most of which are
     simply not worth considering. For example, a route from Phoenix to Indianapolis
     that passes through Seattle is obviously a poor choice, because Seattle is several
     hundred miles out of the way.
        In this chapter and in Chapter 25, we show how to solve such problems ef-
     ﬁciently. In a shortest-paths problem, we are given a weighted, directed graph
     G D .V; E/, with weight function w W E ! R mapping edges to real-valued
     weights. The weight w.p/ of path p D h0 ; 1 ; : : : ; k i is the sum of the weights
     of its constituent edges:
              X
              k
     w.p/ D          w.i 1 ; i / :
              i D1

     We deﬁne the shortest-path weight ı.u; / from u to  by
               (               p
                 minfw.p/ W u ; g if there is a path from u to  ;
     ı.u; / D
                 1                    otherwise :
     A shortest path from vertex u to vertex  is then deﬁned as any path p with weight
     w.p/ D ı.u; /.
        In the Phoenix-to-Indianapolis example, we can model the road map as a graph:
     vertices represent intersections, edges represent road segments between intersec-
     tions, and edge weights represent road distances. Our goal is to ﬁnd a shortest path
     from a given intersection in Phoenix to a given intersection in Indianapolis.
