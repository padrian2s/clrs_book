   By using the linearity of expectation, we can obtain the same result with sub-
stantially less algebra. Let Xi be the random variable describing the number of
successes in the ith trial. Then E ŒXi  D p  1 C q  0 D p, and by linearity of
expectation (equation (C.21)), the expected number of successes for n trials is

        D np :                                                               (C.38)
  We can use the same approach to calculate the variance of the distribution. Using
equation (C.27), we have Var ŒXi  D E ŒXi2   E2 ŒXi . Since Xi only takes on the
values 0 and 1, we have Xi2 D Xi , which implies E ŒXi2  D E ŒXi  D p. Hence,
Var ŒXi  D p  p 2 D p.1  p/ D pq :                                        (C.39)
   To compute the variance of X , we take advantage of the independence of the n
trials; thus, by equation (C.29),
                    " n     #
                     X
Var ŒX  D Var           Xi
                            i D1
                X

          D              Var ŒXi 
                i D1
                X n
          D              pq
                i D1
          D npq :                                                            (C.40)
   As Figure C.2 shows, the binomial distribution b.kI n; p/ increases with k until
it reaches the mean np, and then it decreases. We can prove that the distribution
always behaves in this manner by looking at the ratio of successive terms:
