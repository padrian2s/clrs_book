C         Counting and Probability




          This appendix reviews elementary combinatorics and probability theory. If you
          have a good background in these areas, you may want to skim the beginning of this
          appendix lightly and concentrate on the later sections. Most of this book’s chapters
          do not require probability, but for some chapters it is essential.
             Section C.1 reviews elementary results in counting theory, including standard
          formulas for counting permutations and combinations. The axioms of probability
          and basic facts concerning probability distributions form Section C.2. Random
          variables are introduced in Section C.3, along with the properties of expectation
          and variance. Section C.4 investigates the geometric and binomial distributions
          that arise from studying Bernoulli trials. The study of the binomial distribution
          continues in Section C.5, an advanced discussion of the “tails” of the distribution.


C.1 Counting

          Counting theory tries to answer the question “How many?” without actually enu-
          merating all the choices. For example, we might ask, “How many different n-bit
          numbers are there?” or “How many orderings of n distinct elements are there?” In
          this section, we review the elements of counting theory. Since some of the material
          assumes a basic understanding of sets, you might wish to start by reviewing the
          material in Section B.1.

          Rules of sum and product
          We can sometimes express a set of items that we wish to count as a union of disjoint
          sets or as a Cartesian product of sets.
             The rule of sum says that the number of ways to choose one element from one
          of two disjoint sets is the sum of the cardinalities of the sets. That is, if A and B
          are two ﬁnite sets with no members in common, then jA [ Bj D jAj C jBj, which
