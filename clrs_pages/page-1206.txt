The number of k-permutations of an n-set is
                                         nŠ
n.n  1/.n  2/    .n  k C 1/ D            ;                             (C.1)
                                      .n  k/Š
since we have n ways to choose the ﬁrst element, n  1 ways to choose the second
element, and so on, until we have selected k elements, the last being a selection
from the remaining n  k C 1 elements.

Combinations
A k-combination of an n-set S is simply a k-subset of S. For example, the 4-set
fa; b; c; d g has six 2-combinations:
ab; ac; ad; bc; bd; cd :
(Here we use the shorthand of denoting the 2-subset fa; bg by ab, and so on.)
We can construct a k-combination of an n-set by choosing k distinct (different)
elements from the n-set. The order in which we select the elements does not matter.
   We can express the number of k-combinations of an n-set in terms of the number
of k-permutations of an n-set. Every k-combination has exactly kŠ permutations
of its elements, each of which is a distinct k-permutation of the n-set. Thus, the
number of k-combinations of an n-set is the number of k-permutations divided
by kŠ; from equation (C.1), this quantity is
     nŠ
            :                                                                (C.2)
kŠ .n  k/Š
For k D 0, this formula tells us that the number of ways to choose 0 elements from
an n-set is 1 (not 0), since 0Š D 1.

Binomial coefﬁcients
The notation kn (read “n choose k”) denotes the number of k-combinations of
an n-set. From equation (C.2), we have
    !
  n           nŠ
      D              :
  k      kŠ .n  k/Š

This formula is symmetric in k and n  k:
