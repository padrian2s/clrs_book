           29-5 Minimum-cost circulation
           In this problem, we consider a variant of the minimum-cost-ﬂow problem from
           Section 29.2 in which we are not given a demand, a source, or a sink. Instead,
           we are given, as before, a ﬂow network and edge costs a.u; /. A ﬂow is feasible
           if it satisﬁes the capacity constraint on every edge and ﬂow conservation at every
           vertex. The goal is to ﬁnd, among all feasible ﬂows, the one of minimum cost. We
           call this problem the minimum-cost-circulation problem.
           a. Formulate the minimum-cost-circulation problem as a linear program.

           b. Suppose that for all edges .u; / 2 E, we have a.u; / > 0. Characterize an
              optimal solution to the minimum-cost-circulation problem.

           c. Formulate the maximum-ﬂow problem as a minimum-cost-circulation problem
              linear program. That is given a maximum-ﬂow problem instance G D .V; E/
              with source s, sink t and edge capacities c, create a minimum-cost-circulation
              problem by giving a (possibly different) network G 0 D .V 0 ; E 0 / with edge
              capacities c 0 and edge costs a0 such that you can discern a solution to the
              maximum-ﬂow problem from a solution to the minimum-cost-circulation prob-
              lem.

           d. Formulate the single-source shortest-path problem as a minimum-cost-circu-
              lation problem linear program.


Chapter notes

           This chapter only begins to study the wide ﬁeld of linear programming. A num-
           ber of books are devoted exclusively to linear programming, including those by
           Chvátal [69], Gass [130], Karloff [197], Schrijver [303], and Vanderbei [344].
           Many other books give a good coverage of linear programming, including those
           by Papadimitriou and Steiglitz [271] and Ahuja, Magnanti, and Orlin [7]. The
           coverage in this chapter draws on the approach taken by Chvátal.
