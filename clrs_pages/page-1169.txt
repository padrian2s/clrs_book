       Telescoping series
       For any sequence a0 ; a1 ; : : : ; an ,
       Xn
          .ak  ak1 / D an  a0 ;                                                         (A.9)
       kD1
       since each of the terms a1 ; a2 ; : : : ; an1 is added in exactly once and subtracted out
       exactly once. We say that the sum telescopes. Similarly,
       X
       n1
             .ak  akC1 / D a0  an :
       kD0
       As an example of a telescoping sum, consider the series
       X
       n1
                1
                      :
             k.k C 1/
       kD1
       Since we can rewrite each term as
           1        1      1
                 D             ;
       k.k C 1/     k kC1
       we get
       X
       n1                 n1 
                           X              

           k.k C 1/               k kC1

       Products
       We can write the ﬁnite product a1 a2    an as
       Yn
          ak :
       kD1
       If n D 0, the value of the product is deﬁned to be 1. We can convert a formula with
       a product to a formula with a summation by using the identity
                  !
