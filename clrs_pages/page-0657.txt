636   Chapter 23 Minimum Spanning Trees


         Figure 23.5 shows how Prim’s algorithm works. Lines 1–5 set the key of each
      vertex to 1 (except for the root r, whose key is set to 0 so that it will be the
      ﬁrst vertex processed), set the parent of each vertex to NIL, and initialize the min-
      priority queue Q to contain all the vertices. The algorithm maintains the following
      three-part loop invariant:
         Prior to each iteration of the while loop of lines 6–11,
         1. A D f.; :/ W  2 V  frg  Qg.
         2. The vertices already placed into the minimum spanning tree are those in
            V  Q.
         3. For all vertices  2 Q, if : ¤ NIL , then :key < 1 and :key is
            the weight of a light edge .; :/ connecting  to some vertex already
            placed into the minimum spanning tree.

      Line 7 identiﬁes a vertex u 2 Q incident on a light edge that crosses the cut
      .V  Q; Q/ (with the exception of the ﬁrst iteration, in which u D r due to line 4).
      Removing u from the set Q adds it to the set V  Q of vertices in the tree, thus
      adding .u; u:/ to A. The for loop of lines 8–11 updates the key and  attributes
      of every vertex  adjacent to u but not in the tree, thereby maintaining the third
      part of the loop invariant.
         The running time of Prim’s algorithm depends on how we implement the min-
      priority queue Q. If we implement Q as a binary min-heap (see Chapter 6), we
      can use the B UILD -M IN -H EAP procedure to perform lines 1–5 in O.V / time. The
      body of the while loop executes jV j times, and since each E XTRACT-M IN opera-
      tion takes O.lg V / time, the total time for all calls to E XTRACT-M IN is O.V lg V /.
      The for loop in lines 8–11 executes O.E/ times altogether, since the sum of the
      lengths of all adjacency lists is 2 jEj. Within the for loop, we can implement the
      test for membership in Q in line 9 in constant time by keeping a bit for each vertex
      that tells whether or not it is in Q, and updating the bit when the vertex is removed
      from Q. The assignment in line 11 involves an implicit D ECREASE -K EY opera-
      tion on the min-heap, which a binary min-heap supports in O.lg V / time. Thus,
      the total time for Prim’s algorithm is O.V lg V C E lg V / D O.E lg V /, which is
      asymptotically the same as for our implementation of Kruskal’s algorithm.
         We can improve the asymptotic running time of Prim’s algorithm by using Fi-
      bonacci heaps. Chapter 19 shows that if a Fibonacci heap holds jV j elements, an
      E XTRACT-M IN operation takes O.lg V / amortized time and a D ECREASE -K EY
      operation (to implement line 11) takes O.1/ amortized time. Therefore, if we use a
      Fibonacci heap to implement the min-priority queue Q, the running time of Prim’s
      algorithm improves to O.E C V lg V /.
